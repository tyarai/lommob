1|introduction|It gives us great pleasure to present this new App for Lemur-Watching; the first of its kind ever produced. This App is based on the third and fourth editions of Lemurs of Madagascar, with updates since the most recent of these, the French version, was published in 2014. As you will see, one of the main purposes of this App is to stimulate Lemur Ecotourism in the form of Lemur-Watching and Lemur Life-Listing, part of a global effort to stimulate Primate Ecotourism worldwide. We hope that this new tool will further encourage people to visit Madagascar and contribute to the conservation of these very endangered creatures, one of the most fascinating group of animals on our planet. 

As is already well known, Madagascar is without a doubt the world’s highest primate conservation priority, with very high species diversity and unmatched endemism at the species, genus, and family levels. It is the second country on the world list for primate species diversity (in spite of being less than 7% the size of Brazil, the world leader in this respect, and roughly one-third the size of Indonesia, the third on the list), and its 103 species (107 taxa when you include subspecies) are all endemic.1 This diversity is even more striking at the generic and family levels—fully five families and 15 genera are found nowhere else. Compare this to Brazil, the richest country on Earth in terms of primate species and subspecies, with 149 (85 or 57% of which are endemic); only three of its 18 genera are endemic, and none of its five families.

Furthermore, based on the most recent IUCN Red-Listing Workshop, held in Antananarivo in July, 2012, 87% of the lemurs are now threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of 2015; 24 of these are Critically Endangered, 49 are Endangered, and another 20 are Vulnerable. Four of the species and subspecies are currently listed as Data Deficient, and the threatened status of another four species, described after the 2012 workshop, have yet to be assessed. 

Looking at Madagascar’s primate diversity in yet another way, although it is only one of 86 countries to have wild primate populations, it alone is home to 15% (107 of 702) of all primate species and subspecies, 20% (15 of 76) of all primate genera, and 36% (5 of 16) of all primate families—a great responsibility for one single nation.

Madagascar also demonstrates clearly that primate extinctions are a very real phenomenon and not just a figment of the conservationist’s imagination (see Extinct Lemurs). Fully eight genera and at least 17 species of lemur have already gone extinct on this island since the arrival of our own species there roughly 2,000 years ago. As indicated in the pages that follow, many others could disappear within the next few decades if rapid action is not taken. Today, the major threats to lemurs include deforestation due to slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy in Madagascar), logging, firewood collection, charcoal production, the seasonal burning of dry forests to create cattle pasture, and live capture of lemurs as pets. Sadly, the hunting of lemurs as a source of food, a threat that we used to consider less severe than in other parts of the world, is now emerging as a major problem in many areas. It therefore requires special attention.

What is more, Madagascar is just coming out of a five-year  period of political turmoil, with a coup that took place in early 2009 and a government that lasted until the end of 2013, unrecognized by any other nation on Earth. Although many conservation activities continued in spite of the political problems, the breakdown of law and order in certain parts of the country had serious impacts, and much of it continues to the present day even under the legitimate government of President Hery Rajaonarimampianina, elected in December 2013, and inaugurated in January, 2014. This has especially been the case in parks and reserves with valuable timber such as the national parks of Marojejy and Masoala in the northeastern part of the country. Almost immediately following the onset of the crisis, illegal loggers moved into both of these protected areas. Organized hunting of lemurs for commercial purposes sprung up in that region as well, but now appears to be under control—at least for the time-being—as a result of a concerted international press campaign that brought the issue to the attention of the Malagasy authorities. To further exacerbate the problem, most international donor agencies suspended their support to Madagascar, excepting only assistance for the most dire humanitarian situations. This suspension has included support for conservation programs from bilateral agencies, the World Bank, and others. Most of the international and national non-governmental organizations, however, continued to be active in Madagascar even during the crisis, and we were able to maintain many of the most important programs, although with far less resources. Fortunately, following the election of President Rajaonarimampianina, much of this foreign assistance has been reinstated, but the capacity to absorb new resources remains somewhat limited.

Conservation International and the Primate Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Species Survival Commission (IUCN SSC), along with numerous other organizations, have long recognized Madagascar as one of their top priorities. Our four editions of Lemurs of Madagascar were designed to facilitate the identification of lemurs in the field and to summarize available data on their ecology, distribution and conservation status—in the hope that this would stimulate further interest in the survival of these animals in their natural habitats. The same is now true of this Lemur-Watching App. Amazingly, in spite of several centuries of observation and collection and five decades of research, we are still discovering new species, we are not clear as to the limits of the distributions of many of the known species, and we have at best only anecdotal information on the conservation status and population numbers for the majority of them.

Increased field and laboratory research is showing us how little we knew of these animals as recently as a decade ago. Indeed, a total of 48 lemur species and subspecies previously unknown to science have been described since the first edition of this guide was published in 1994; four of them since the fourth edition in 2014. Since 1994, a further nine old names have been resurrected from the literature (Microcebus griseorufus, Cheirogaleus crossleyi, Cheirogaleus sibreei, Cheirogaleus thomasi, Lepilemur ankaranensis, Hapalemur meridionalis, Eulemur rufifrons, Varecia variegata editorum and Varecia variegata subcincta) based on a re-evaluation of the diversity of each genus2. Much of this work has been conducted by authors of this volume. As we launch this App, we know of still more that await formal description, along with a number of others that may be new to science but which need further investigation. All these additions will bring the total lemur list for Madagascar to well over 110 and perhaps as many as 125, an amazing number for an island this size and with so little habitat remaining. Madagascar is sometimes referred to as the “eighth continent,” and for primates this is certainly the case since this particular fauna is comparable in every way to that of Africa, South and Central America, and Asia.
###########################################################
In addition to the description of previously unknown taxa, field research continues to fill the gaps in our knowledge of species once believed to be extremely rare and endangered. Two good examples are the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) and the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis). Both were once believed to be nearly extinct, but they now continue to be found at new (though still widely dispersed) sites in different parts of the country. Neither is ever found in large numbers nor at high densities, so we cannot consider their populations to be secure, but their situation is certainly better than had been believed as recently as 15–20 years ago.

On the other hand, with the description of so many new species (splitting up what were once considered wide-ranging forms), the conservation challenge increases dramatically. Indeed, many of the new taxa are known only from their type localities, and quite a few have tiny ranges in areas of extreme habitat fragmentation. Surely, as knowledge increases, a number of these new forms are likely to enter the ranks of the Endangered and even the Critically Endangered.

Given the amazing diversity of Madagascar’s lemur fauna and its great global importance, it is sobering to reflect on the extent of the degradation and loss of their forest habitats. By the 1950’s only 27% of Madagascar was forested3 and this had further declined to an estimated 16% by 2005 (Harper et al., 2007; MEFT, USAID and CI, 2009). About 50,000 ha of forest was destroyed each year between 2000 and 2005 (MEFT, USAID and CI, 2009). This equates to a current cover of about 94,000 km² of spiny, dry and humid forests (MEFT, USAID and CI, 2009)—an area roughly equivalent to the American state of Indiana. However, it should be remembered that the fragmentation and isolation of the forest fragments is extreme. Harper et al. (2007) calculated that the area of what they termed “core forest” (forest more than 1 km from a forest edge) decreased from more than 90,000 km² in the 1950s to less than 20,000 km² in 2000. The area in patches of 100 km² or more decreased by more than half in that period.

In 2003, only about 3% of Madagascar’s land area was protected, which corresponds to around 17,000 km² (1.7 million ha) or slightly more than the size of Connecticut, and only a small portion of that was effectively managed. In light of this, it was particularly encouraging when, in 2003, the Government of Madagascar committed to tripling the country's protected area coverage in five years (subsequently revised to be by the end of 2012). This pledge was announced by President Marc Ravalomanana in September 2003, at the 5th World Parks Congress in Durban, South Africa. This historic declaration served as a rallying point for everyone concerned for the biodiversity in Madagascar. Subsequently named “The Durban Vision,” this commitment attracted major international attention and funding.  What is more, the government has made good progress towards this goal, creating 29 new protected areas covering 30,000 km², with the creation of a further 40 additional reserves covering 11,000 km² still underway. By January 2010, there were 4.7 million ha of protected area in Madagascar, and the government, NGOs and community groups were actively working to create a further 1 million ha.

Fortunately, President Rajaonarimampianina has maintained “The Durban Vision,” and strongly reinforced it at the 6th World Parks Congress in Sydney, Australia, in November, 2014, 11 years after Ravalomanana’s original declaration. He promised to make “official” all new protected areas created under “The Durban Vision” by May, 2015, a promise that he has since kept.

The international community has pledged more than $50 million to a trust fund to cover some of the recurrent costs of the country's parks and reserves, a figure that was achieved by March, 2008, and continues to grow. Other funds are also providing significant support to Madagascar. The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), for example, provides grants to non-governmental organizations so that they can conserve the world's biodiversity hotspots. In this context, CEPF granted $4.25 million to 40 projects implemented in Madagascar between 2001 and 2006, and $1.4 million to 10 projects from 2009 to 2012. Subsequent to this initial investment of $5.65 million, CEPF has now committed another $7.5 million to be spent in Madagascar and the neighboring Indian Ocean islands during the period 2015−2020.

It is hoped that this first-ever App for Lemur-Watching will make a new contribution by providing user-friendly access to the most up-to-date information and by stimulating Lemur-Watching for everyone interested. The ecotourism industry, which had been growing steadily prior to the 2009 coup and which seems to be picking up once again, was fully espoused and supported by the government and by private enterprise. Indeed, it should continue as a major foreign exchange earner for the country, providing a strong economic justification for the maintenance and protection of parks, reserves and natural habitats. Since lemurs are the most attractive, conspicuous and best known component of Madagascar’s wildlife, they are ideally suited to stimulate the growth of ecotourism, and they continue to be Madagascar’s wildlife ambassadors to the world.

2|origin|The island of Madagascar once formed part of the great southern landmass of Gondwana. This enormous supercontinent began to break apart about 180 million years ago into the individual landmasses we know today as Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia and the Indian subcontinent. Initially, Madagascar remained attached to Africa, but about 160 million years ago, together with the Indian subcontinent, it began to break away from Africa. East and West Gondwana fragmented further, but the Indian subcontinent and Madagascar remained joined together as “Indo-Madagascar” for another 70 million years before finally separating about 90 million years ago. By that time, Madagascar had assumed its present position relative to the east coast of Africa, separated by the Mozambique Channel. The channel is just over 400 km wide at its narrowest point.
This has interesting implications for the origin of lemurs and Madagascar´s biological uniqueness. The island, it was widely assumed, had merely parted from Africa with a sampling of that continent’s fauna aboard. While Africa’s fauna saw a great deal of replacement of one group by another over the course of the epochs that followed, the fauna of isolated Madagascar did not.
If Madagascar has been essentially where it is now in relation to Africa for the past 90 million years or so, we cannot explain the presence of lemurs in Madagascar by an African “founder effect” (although this may explain the presence of some of the more ancient members of the island’s biota).
Divergence time estimates based on a number of studies have indicated the lemuroid dispersal to have occurred between 80 to more than 50 million years ago. 
Nevertheless, even if the ancestors of the primates were much older than was previously thought, and even that certain key events in mammalian evolution took place in Africa a little earlier than in the northern continents, it would still seem that the ancestors of today’s lemurs most likely reached Madagascar by a sea crossing from Africa(Yoder et al., 1996; Roos et al., 2004). Large, matted clumps of floating vegetation are routinely washed down major rivers and out to sea, sometimes with unwilling mammals and other passengers aboard. Despite the width of the Mozambique Channel, Madagascar’s lemurs most likely represent one more such case.
There are a number of aspects, however, which need to be considered before accepting this as an explanation, not least among them whether sea currents and winds would favor, or even permit, a passage from the continent where the ancestors were presumed to have lived, and also whether the passage would be short enough for the survival of the unwilling passengers. This last aspect was discussed by Kappeler (2001), who indicated that torpor or month-long hibernation, a trait of Microcebusd and Cheirogaleus, would have contributed to the likelihood of survival of a sea passage. This was based on the incorrect supposition by Purvis (1995), that the mouse and dwarf lemurs are the most ancestral of the living lemurs. They are in fact one of the more recent lineages (see below). Stankiewicz et al. (2005) reviewed and investigated the possibilities concerning the likelihood of a sea crossing, taking into account even such fortuitous events as freak winds and tornados or trees on the floating vegetation which could act as a sail. Their unequivocal conclusion was that “current and wind trajectories [as they are today] show that the most likely fate for a raft emerging from an estuary on the east coast of Africa is to follow the Mozambique current and become beached back on the African coast.”(p.1.
Another possibility that has been raised is that islands or even a bridge was formed from peaks along the north-south running Davie Ridge in the Mozambique Channel at times when sea level was lower, which could have facilitated a crossing (e.g., Tattersall, 1982; McCall, 1997; Masters et al., 2006). This would have occurred during the second half of the Eocene and the idea that it might have allowed for the lemur colonization of Madagascar by the ancestral lemur was suggested by McCall (1997) based on a divergence time for the lemuroids and lorisoids at about 40 million years ago A land bridge has also been discounted for geological reasons (Rabinowitz and Woods, 2006) and even if there were small islands at some time during the Cenozoic, they still would have been separated by hundreds of kilometers of ocean (Ali and Huber 2010). Krause et al. (1997) suggested that the currents in the Mozambique Channel may have been favorable for a crossing from Africa to Madgascar in the Late Cretaceous, about 65 million years ago, when Madagascar and Africa layed about 15º further south from where they are now. This possibility was strongly supported by Ali and Huber (2010) who, using paleo-oceanographic modeling, concluded that in the Eocene epoch strong currents in the Mozambique Channel certainly would have flowed eastward and that there were occasions when so-called “trajectories” starting in the region of northeast Mozambique and Tanzania would have fast, jet-like eddies with velocities indicating that crossings to Madagascar could have been possible in 25–30 days or even less. Ali and Huber (2010) concluded that favorable currents would have persisted through the Oligocene, but that Madagascar, moving north, would have breached the margin of the subtropical and equatorial gyres by the early Miocene, and currents thereafter would have been perennially directed westwards, as they are today.
###
All subsequent genetic analyses have confirmed lemur monophyly, i.e., all lemurs are the descendants of a single successful colonization event (Yoder et al., 1996; Roos et al., 2004; Yoder and Yang, 2004, Karanth et al., 2005; Horvath et al., 2008). Supporting the findings of Roos et al. (2004) and Yoder and Yang (2004), Hovarth et al. (2008) concluded that the diversification of lemurs on Madagascar began with the separation of the lineage leading to the aye-aye (Daubentonia), about years ago 54.9–74.7 million years ago, extending as such across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary of 65 million years ago. Current evidence indicates that further splits of lemurs into families did not begin to occur until about 42 million years ago, more than 20 million years later in the middle Eocene, but the possibility remains that there were unrecorded lineage extinctions during this time (Yoder and Yang, 2004). The first major divergence in evidence today, following that of the separation of Daubentonia, was between the “true” lemurs (Lemuridae) and the ancestors of the Cheirogaleidae, Lepilemuridae and Indriidae. The indriids subsequently separated, and then the lepilemurids, all within a period of about 10 million years (Yoder and Yang, 2004).
Madagascar is the last place on Earth to have experienced the disappearance of diverse groups of large indigenous mammals (megafauna), and one of the last habitable continental regions to be colonized by humans. Most of the documented extinctions occurred after the ﬁrst arrival of humans on Madagascar, about 2,000 years ago (Burney et al., 2004). The earliest date for man’s presence came from cut marks suggesting the removal of flesh from a radius bone of a sloth lemur (Palaeopropithecus ingens) dated at 2,325±43 years before present (Perez et al., 2003).

Elephant birds, relatives of the ostrich, the largest of which stood 3 m tall and at 450 kg probably the heaviest bird that ever lived, were still present on the island near the end of the of the first millennium A.D., as were at least 16 species of large, now extinct lemurs. The stratigraphic resolution of this megafaunal “extinction window” is estimated to have been between 500 and 1,500 years ago. At least 53 species of large Malagasy mammals, birds, and reptiles have become extinct, leaving the region with no indigenous terrestrial vertebrates of a body weight greater than 12 kg.

In the next chapter we discuss in more detail the nature, natural history of the 17 large and remarkable lemurs that tragically are now extinct. Their loss emphasizes that the lemurs surviving today could face a similar fate if major conservation efforts currently underway are not effective.


3|extinctlemurs|Since the arrival of humans on Madagascar, fully eight genera and at least 17 lemur species have gone extinct (Figs. 3.3 and 3.4). This represents 15% of all known species of lemurs and over one-third of all known genera, and it is noteworthy that all of the now extinct species were larger than those that survive today. There are 73 living primate genera and these eight extinct lemur genera represent as such a loss of 10% of the world’s primates in historic times. This loss of lemurs in Madagascar in geologically very recent times is a dramatic example of the kind of extinction spasm that conservationists are constantly warning us about and, indeed, many of the surviving lemur species could fall victim to the same fate if conservationists are unsuccessful in their efforts. We describe this extinct fauna in order to convey some sense of the catastrophic loss of primate diversity that this unique island has already experienced, in the hope that it will make us redouble our efforts to save those that remain. A century ago, C. I. Forsyth Major (1894a) described the first subfossil remains of giant extinct lemurs recovered from marshes in the center and southwest of Madagascar. Not only were these remains clearly those of lemurs much larger than any which survive today, they were equally clearly of no great antiquity (hence the “subfossil” appellation). In a review published as early as 1905, the paleontologist Guillaume Grandidier, was able to show that many more names than necessary had been bestowed upon the large collection of subfossil lemur bones that had been amassed by that time. However, among those names were most of the extinct genera recognized today. Despite extensive excavations during the first half of the century, notably by Charles Lamberton (1934a, 1934b, 1936a, 1936b, 1938) of the Académie Malgache, no new extinct lemur genera were recovered between the first decade of the century and the late 1980s. In 1986, a team led by Elwyn Simons of Duke University began work in karst caves on the Ankarana Massif in the far north of Madagascar. Besides discovering at least one new genus of extinct lemur (Babakotia), this team has made finds that have caused considerable rethinking of the adaptations of the extinct lemurs and the relationships among them. The team also made finds indicating that species that still survive today, among them Prolemur simus and Indri indri, once had much more extensive ranges. Until the mid-20th century, subfossil lemurs were known almost exclusively from the center, south and southwest of Madagascar. Now, however, the only major biogeographic region of Madagascar where subrecent fauna remains unsampled is the eastern rain forest. Perhaps even more importantly, the recent era of fieldwork has allowed the collection of complete or relatively complete skeletons in which skulls and the various elements of the body skeleton are positively associated. This contrasts with earlier excavations in which bones tended to be dredged up one by one from swamps and muddy marsh bottoms. Given such circumstances of excavation, the association of postcranial bones with skulls and with each other tended to be a matter of guesswork and size-matching. As it turned out, this was not the most accurate procedure. Most of currently known subfossil sites consist either of marsh deposits (dried to varying extents) or of deposits washed into limestone caves or fissures. Most such sites are rich in the bones of many other vertebrates besides primates (living as well as extinct). Common among such remains are those of pygmy hippopotami, giant tortoises and the famous elephant birds (Aepyornis and Mullerornis). Of particular interest is the Ankilitelo pit cave in the karst landscape of the Mikoboka Plateau in southwestern Madagascar. It has a uniquely rich subfossil mammal fauna (34 species in all), which is very recent (around 500 years old), making it one of the most diverse Holocene assemblages in Madagascar (Simons et al., 2004; Muldoon et al., 2009a, 2009b). It is an extraordinarily rich repository for five species of extinct giant lemurs: Palaeopropithecus ingens, Megaladapis madagascariensis, Archaeolemur majori, Daubentonia robusta, and Pachylemur (Wunderlich et al., 1996; Jungers et al., 1997, 2005; Godfrey et al., 1999; Hamrick et al., 2000; Simons et al., 2004; Shapiro et al., 2005). All of the subfossil sites are strictly localized, and all are of comparatively recent age. Most radiocarbon dates that have been obtained so far cluster in the period between about 2,500 and 1,000 years ago, and only one or two stretch back to the final millennia of the last Ice Age, which ended around 10,000 years ago. These are not very ancient ages by any standard, and they show that subfossil and living lemurs all form part of the same contemporary fauna; the extinct lemurs are in no way the precursors of those that still survive.
