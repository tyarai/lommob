28|CHEIROGALEIDAE Gray, 1873|The family Cheirogaleidae has five genera and 30 species: Microcebus, the mouse lemurs (18 species); Allocebus, the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (one species); Mirza, giant mouse lemurs (two species); Cheirogaleus, the dwarf lemurs (five species); and Phaner, the fork-marked lemurs (four species). No subspecies are recognized at the present time. Cheirogaleid lemurs range in size from the world’s smallest primate at about 30 g to almost 600 g. All move quadrupedally and most have elongated bodies with short legs. At least one species of cheirogaleid can be found in any natural forest of reasonable size in Madagascar.
All members of this family are nocturnal, sleeping during the day in small nests of dead leaves, in tree holes, or in holes in the ground. Some cheirogaleids undergo prolonged periods of seasonal torpor. 




Microcebus É. Geoffroy, 1828 Mouse Lemurs 
The genus Microcebus includes the smallest of the lemurs and indeed the smallest of all living primates. These tiny animals range in weight from 30 to 87 g and in length from about 23 to 29 cm (including tail), and all are nocturnal in habit. Until recently, very few species were recognized in this genus. Schwarz (1931), for example, recognized only one with two subspecies. Field work by Martin (1972a) indicated that the two subspecies were in fact distinct species, Microcebus rufus and M. murinus. Petter et al. (1977) continued to recognize two subspecies, but noted that there was geographical variation in both the eastern and western areas of their distribution. Subsequent field studies in western and northern Madagascar in the 1990s led to the resurrection of the name myoxinus (see Schmid and Kappeler, 1994) and the discovery of a new species, M. ravelobensis Zimmermann et al., 1997. Later still, more field work in western Madagascar, coupled with genetic analyses, resulted in the addition of three new species, M. berthae, M. sambiranensis and M. tavaratra, a clarification of the status of M. myoxinus, and the elevation of a previously described subspecies to a full species, M. griseorufus (see Rasoloarison et al., 2000; Yoder et al., 2000b; Hapke et al., 2003a). These researchers also indicated that eastern M. rufus might also include more than a single species, and Groves (2001) drew attention to differences between northeastern and southern specimens within the form recognized as M. rufus. This has now been confirmed by recent field and laboratory studies that have resulted in the description of an additional ten species as we go to press in 2010, all in what was formerly considered the range of M. rufus. These include M. lehilahytsara described in Kappeler et al. (2005), M. danfossi and M. bongolavensis described by Olivieri et al. (2007a), M. mamiratra described by Andriantompohavana et al. (2006), M. jollyae, M. mittermeieri and M. simmonsi described by Louis et al. (2006a), M. macarthurii described by Radespiel et al. (2008), and M. arnholdi and M. margotmarshae described by Louis et al. (2008). In this field guide we provide full accounts for all 18 presently-recognized species while at the same time recognizing that the taxonomy of this genus will continue to undergo further revision. Anticipated are formal descriptions of two more species mentioned in Louis et al. (2006a) (from Manombo and Vevembe, respectively) and one species mentioned in Radespiel et al. (2008). 



Mouse lemurs are present throughout Madagascar wherever suitable natural habitat remains, including primary and secondary forest and even disturbed habitats. They are often among the most abundant mammals in areas where they occur. Typically, mouse lemurs are sympatric with at least one other nocturnal lemur, and very often three, four, or even five. Two Microcebus species may be sympatric in some areas as well.
In the field, Microcebus can be distinguished from Cheirogaleus by its much smaller size and more active movements, and from Mirza by its smaller size. Phaner is larger, much more vocal, and easily distinguished by its fork-mark and its bobbing movements. Lepilemur, Avahi, and Daubentonia are all much larger and cannot be confused with Microcebus. The one genus which presents problems is Allocebus, since both Microcebus and Allocebus are small, and the latter’s hairy ears are only distinguishable if a very clear, close view is obtained. Mouse lemurs tend to use the lower forest layers and to prefer habitat edges, moving quadrupedally and jumping in rapid bursts. During daylight hours, they seek shelter in tree holes, dense tangles of vegetation, or nests, where they congregate in small groups. During the austral winter, certain species may enter periods of daily and seasonal torpor during which they lose a significant percentage of their body mass, previously stored as fat. Their diet consists mainly of fruit, but also includes small invertebrates, gums and insect excretions. Mouse lemurs are preyed upon by several mammals, and by owls, vangas (Vangidae), and snakes.
Home ranges vary from one to two hectares, those of multiple males and females overlapping. Mouse lemurs can begin to reproduce during their first year of life, typically giving birth once or twice (rarely three times) each year, and often producing twins. Much of what is currently known about mouse lemurs is well summarized in Kappeler and Rasoloarison (2003).
There are many opportunities for visitors to Madagascar to see mouse lemurs in the wild, but only if they are willing to don a headlamp or flashlight and embark on a night walk. Be prepared to listen for high-pitched, squeaking vocalizations and to look for the tiny eyes shining back in the beam of your flashlight from the shrub layer up to the middle levels of the forest. However, do not expect the mouse lemur to sit in your beam for too long, as would be the case with the less active Cheirogaleus or Lepilemur. Mouse lemurs are active and will move away from the light, although you can usually follow them for short distances. Occasionally, with a little luck, one will freeze in the beam of your light, allowing you to approach to within a meter or so and perhaps even take a photo.|150
196|LEPILEMURIDAE Gray, 1870|Most previous authors placed the sportive lemurs of the genus Lepilemur in the separate family Lepilemuridae. Groves (2001) placed Lepilemur together with the extinct giant lemur, genus Megaladapis, in the Megaladapidae but, based on recent genetic analyses (Yoder et al., 1999b; Karanth et al., 2005), other experts have decided that the relationship between these two lineages is not as close as Groves indicated, and have gone back to separating out the Lepilemuridae. We prefer this arrangement, and return to recognizing Lepilemuridae as separate from the Megaladapidae, and containing a single genus, Lepilemur.
Lepilemur I. Geoffroy, 1851 Sportive Lemurs
The genus Lepilemur contains at least 26 named species, most of which have been described in the past ten years. All are medium-sized, largely folivorous, and nocturnal. Sportive lemurs generally weigh less than one kilogram and are approximately half a meter in length, including the tail. They are vertical clingers and leapers, with legs that are elongated compared to their trunks and arms. The face of Lepilemur is covered with short hairs. Its identification in the field would most likely be confused with the genus Avahi, another medium-sized, nocturnal lemur, but sportive lemurs tend to be a bit smaller, have more prominent ears, and lack the highly visible white patches on the back of the thighs that are so typical of Avahi. Avahi also has a strong tendency to huddle tightly with family members in clusters of two to four animals, sometimes even during the night when they are active. Lepilemur will do this in its daytime sleeping sites, but rarely at night, making this behavior a reasonably good field characteristic. At first glance, or in poor viewing conditions, Lepilemur may also be confused with the larger dwarf lemurs, especially Cheirogaleus major and Cheirogaleus crossleyi in Madagascar’s eastern rain forests. However, Lepilemur is a vertical clinger and leaper, whereas Cheirogaleus moves quadrupedally, and Cheirogaleus species usually have a contrasting white belly. Sportive lemurs can also be readily differentiated from most other nocturnal lemur species by their loud screams, except for Phaner which vocalizes even more loudly. However, this field character is useful only at certain times of the year, when these animals are vocally active.
Sportive lemurs are the smallest of the folivorous primates (Ganzhorn, 1993). Leaves constitute the bulk of the diet, with flowers, buds, and sometimes fruit taking on greater importance toward the end of the dry season. Most populations appear to inhabit low- and mid-altitude evergreen and deciduous forests. Most of what is known about Lepilemur ecology and behavior comes from studies of western and southern species. During the day, sportive lemurs routinely take shelter and sleep in tree holes or tangles of branches, vines, or lianas, and sometimes can be seen resting in the fork of a tree if such shelters are not available. Lepilemur ruficaudatus and Lepilemur edwardsi live in pairs (Ganzhorn and Kappeler, 1996; Thalmann, 2001; Zinner et al., 2003). The social behavior of the other Lepilemur remains unclear and may vary between species. Significant differences in vocal behavior are very apparent, with rain forest species being relatively silent (Petter et al., 1977) while those from more open, drier forests are more vociferous.
The taxonomy of Lepilemur has been fairly complicated over the past 50 years, and continues to be interesting. Petter and Petter-Rousseaux (1960) recognized a single species, Lepilemur mustelinus, with five subspecies, but Petter et al. (1977) increased this to seven species, with one (Lepilemur septentrionalis) having four subspecies. Tattersall (1982) provisionally recognized a single species (L. mustelinus) with six subspecies, but later concurred with Jenkins (1987) that the genus was represented by seven distinct species. This arrangement was supported by at least one genetic analysis (Ishak et al., 1992) and was accepted by most authors in the 1990s (e.g., Mittermeier et al., 1994).
Rumpler et al. (2001), investigating the cytogenetics of L. septentrionalis, identified karyotypes attributable to two species—L. septentrionalis and L. andrafiamensis—each with two subspecies and with no evidence of hybridization between populations. Groves (2001), in contrast, regarded this assemblage as two subspecies of L. septentrionalis—L. s. septentrionalis to the north and L. s. ankaranensis from the forests of Ankarana and Andrafiamena to the south and west—and suggested that the name ankaranensis has priority over Rumpler’s andrafiamensis. Subsequently, Ravoarimanana et al. (2004) and Rumpler (2004) presented data regarding the geographic range of these taxa, elevating these two forms to species and suggesting that the range of L. septentrionalis was restricted to the forests of Sahafary, a very tiny area in the far eastern part of the range of northern Lepilemur.
In the previous edition of this field guide (2006) we recognized eight full species. Since that time a number of scientific papers have been published, and the taxonomy of the genus has been extensively revised, resulting in an explosion of new species. In 2006, Louis et al. described an incredible 11 new species in a single paper—Lepilemur fleuretae, Lepilemur seali, Lepilemur betsileo, Lepilemur wrightae, Lepilemur jamesorum, Lepilemur ahmansonorum, Lepilemur hubbardorum, Lepilemur petteri, Lepilemur grewcockorum, Lepilemur tymerlachsonorum, and Lepilemur milanoii. That same year, Andriaholinirina et al., described a further three species (Lepilemur. aeeclis, Lepilemur randrianasoloi and Lepilemur sahamalazensis), and Rabarivola et al. described Lepilemur mittermeieri. In 2007, Craul et al. described two more new species (Lepilemur otto and Lepilemur manasamody), in 2008, Lei et al. described Lepilemur scottorum, and most recently, in 2009, Ramaromilanto et al. described Lepilemur. hollandorum. Lepilemur manasomody has since been synonymized with L. grewcockorum (Zinner et al., 2007). There is also some dispute over the precise taxonomy of the forms from the region of Nosy Be and the nearby mainland, which has not yet been resolved. However, the net result has been a tripling of species in this genus since the publication of the last edition of this field guide in 2006. We now recognize 26 species, and anticipate that more may be described in the years to come.

226|LEMURIDAE Gray, 1821|The family Lemuridae consists of two main subgroupings that include the best known and most widespread of the lemurs. The genera Lemur, Eulemur, and Varecia all are considered “true lemurs” and have diets that are largely made up of fruits and leaves. The bamboo lemurs, which include the genera Hapalemur and Prolemur, specialize in eating bamboo although they take other food items as well. Members of the Lemuridae range in weight from 700 g to 4.5 kg. With forelimbs slightly shorter than hindlimbs, they move largely quadrupedally along branches and will leap across gaps in the forest. Typically they live in groups and are active during the day, but all except the ruffed lemurs (Varecia) and the ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur) are also active a certain amount of time during the night, exhibiting an activity pattern referred to as cathemeral (Tattersall, 1987). The extent of this nocturnal activity remains poorly documented in many species, and represents a growing area of interest among primatologists (Curtis and Rasmussen, 2006; Donati et al., 2007; Kappeler and Erkert, 2003). Until the late 1980s, the genus Lemur was considered to include six species and to be closely related to the genus Varecia. However, both Simons and Rumpler (1988) and Groves and Eaglen (1988) suggested that the ring-tailed lemur, Lemur catta, had closer affinities to the bamboo lemurs, Hapalemur, and should therefore be distinguished from other members of the family. As a result, the other species were placed in the genus Eulemur, with only L. catta remaining in the genus Lemur. More recently, Groves (2001) placed the former Hapalemur simus in its own genus, Prolemur, based on a suite of distinctive dental, chromosomal, and behavioral characteristics, and also because its retention in Hapalemur would have made the latter genus paraphyletic (since the sister genus to the Hapalemur griseus group is Lemur, not “H.” simus). We continue to follow this recommendation here, and recognize Hapalemur and Prolemur as distinct genera (Vuillaume-Randriamanantena et al., 1985; Macedonia and Stanger, 1994; Stanger-Hall, 1997). Hapalemur I. Geoffroy, 1851 Bamboo or Gentle Lemurs Members of the genus Hapalemur are best known for a diet dominated by bamboo (Rand, 1935); an unusual ecological specialization among primates. All authorities agree in placing the bamboo lemurs in the family Lemuridae, although considerable uncertainty remains regarding their relationships to other genera in the family. The genus Hapalemur can be readily distinguished from Lemur, Eulemur, and Varecia by features of the head, including its round shape, large face, short muzzle, and ears that are largely hidden by fur. All Hapalemur are medium to small, grayish animals, have moderately long hindlimbs, prefer vertical resting postures, and leap readily between closely-spaced vertical supports. They tend to be crepuscular in their habits. As in Lemur, brachial and antebrachial glands are present (Macedonia and Stanger, 1994). Hapalemur taxonomy, including phylogenetic relationships among members of this genus, is a source of continuing debate (Fausser et al., 2002a, 2002b; Pastorini et al., 2002a, 2002b; Rumpler et al., 2002; Rabarivola et al., 2007). Most authors over the past two decades recognized three species of bamboo lemur: Hapalemur griseus (with at least three subspecies), H. aureus, and H. simus (see Mittermeier et al., 1994). Groves (2001) recently elevated three Hapalemur griseus subspecies to full species status as H. griseus, H. alaotrensis and H. occidentalis, and placed Hapalemur simus in its own genus, Prolemur. He did not, however, recognize the southern bamboo lemur, Hapalemur (griseus) meridionalis Warter et al., 1987, which Fausser et al. (2002a, 2002b) believe is a full species. In this guide, we follow Groves (2001) in moving H. simus to the genus Prolemur and in elevating H. g. griseus, H. g. alaotrensis and H. g. occidentalis to full species, but also follow Fausser et al. (2002) in recognizing H. meridionalis as a full species. In 2007, Rabarivola et al. described two new subspecies of H. griseus (H. g. ranomafanensis and H. g. gilberti). They were described as subspecies rather than as distinct species because available molecular data do not distinguish them. In total, therefore, we currently recognize five species and seven taxa in this genus: H. griseus (with three subspecies), H. occidentalis, H. alaotrensis, H. meridionalis, and H. aureus. However, it is clear that additional research is needed to clarify evolutionary, distributional, and taxonomic relationships in this genus, and also that there may still be new taxa to be discovered.

252|INDRIIDAE Burnett, 1828|The family Indriidae contains three genera: Avahi, Propithecus, and Indri. The first one is small (roughly 1 kg) and nocturnal, the latter two are large (3–9 kg) and diurnal, and include the largest of all living lemurs, the indri (Indri indri) and the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). All three genera are “vertical clingers and leapers,” an unusual postural and locomotor complex among primates. This is characterized by resting postures in which the trunk of the body is held vertically on upright supports and locomotor behavior that involves leaps between vertical supports, sometimes quite spectacular and up to 10 m between trees. Suspensory postures are also a feature of this behavioral complex, especially when feeding and moving in peripheral branches and twigs of trees. Some species also regularly descend to the ground, where they jump bipedally, often with the arms held above the head. This amazing behavior, especially among the smaller sifakas (e.g., Propithecus verreauxi, Propithecus coquereli), has now become quite well known internationally, and is one of the highlights of a visit to Madagascar. All indriids have greatly elongated legs compared to their arms and trunks, and they are highly distinctive and difficult to confuse with other species. Indeed, they are among the most unusual of all primate families. The only real possibility of confusing any indriid with a member of another lemur family is at night, when Avahi might be mistaken for Lepilemur or possibly Cheirogaleus.
Avahi Jourdan, 1834 Woolly Lemurs 
The genus Avahi contains the only nocturnal members of the family Indriidae. The common English name refers to the curly or woolly appearance of the dense fur, while the generic name is a transcription of the animal’s high-pitched vocalization (Thalmann, 2003). Woolly lemurs are much smaller than the indri or any of the sifakas, usually weighing around 1 kg. Nonetheless, they are typical, thigh-powered vertical clingers and leapers, possessing hindlimbs proportionately longer than the trunk and forelimbs. Like the sifakas they have long tails, typically longer than their combined head and body length.
At a distance and at night, Avahi is often difficult to distinguish from species of Lepilemur, which are similar in size and also nocturnal. At reasonably close range, however, woolly lemurs are readily identified by the white patches on the backs of their thighs, which serve as highly visible identification marks when the animals assume their characteristic vertical resting posture. Indeed, this character is so distinctive that it has given rise to one of the most common names for woolly lemurs in Madagascar, “fotsife,” which means “white leg.” At first glance, Avahi may also be confused with Cheirogaleus, especially the larger eastern rain forest species. However, dwarf lemurs do not exhibit the vertical resting posture and are much smaller. Woolly lemurs also frequently rest closely huddled together in pairs or small family units of three or four, behavior rarely observed in the other similar-sized nocturnal genera.
Avahi was originally regarded as a single species, Avahi laniger, with an eastern and a western subspecies (Schwarz, 1931; Tattersall, 1982). Rumpler et al. (1990) subsequently elevated the subspecies to full species: Avahi laniger and Avahi occidentalis. Thalmann 
and Geissmann (2000) later described a third species, Avahi unicolor, from the region of the Ampasindava Peninsula, and more recently a fourth, Avahi cleesei, from the Tsingy de Bemaraha region (Thalmann and Geissmann, 2005). These were followed by two more in 2006, when Zaramody et al. described Avahi peyrierasi and Avahi meridionalis, at the same time suggesting that A. cleesei may be a junior synonym of A. occidentalis. The validity of A. cleesei was subsequently reaffirmed by Andriantompohavana et al. (2007). Although A. meridionalis was originally described with two subspecies—A. m. meridionalis and A. m. ramanantsoavanai–Andriantompohavana et al. (2007) elevated both to full species. In 2007, Andriantompohavana et al. also described the new species Avahi betsileo. Lastly, Lei et al. (2008) described yet another, Avahi mooreorum, bringing the current number of described Avahi species to nine. However, there are strong indications that still more species of Avahi remain to be described, so we are not yet finished with this genus.

272|DAUBENTONIIDAE Gray, 1863|The family Daubentoniidae has just one living species, the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and one extinct species (Daubentonia robusta). The living species is a very unusual nocturnal animal that differs from the other lemurs in many anatomical and behavioral specializations, among them its distinctive dental formula, the continually growing incisor teeth (which led to it being considered a rodent during part of the 19th century), the large ears that are almost certainly used to locate insect larvae in decayed wood, and the thin skeletal middle finger that is used to extract such prey. So unique is the aye-aye that it has proven difficult to determine which other lemurs are its closest relatives. Although it has been suggested that its affinities may lie with the indriids (Schwartz and Tattersall, 1985), all genetic studies (summarized in Quinn and Wilson, 2004) are in agreement that it is the sister-group to all other lemurs, to the extent that Groves (1989, 2001) and Roos et al. (2004) place it in the separate infraorder Chiromyiformes, distinct from the Lemuriformes.
Although only one living species of aye-aye is recognized, remains of a second, extinct species, Daubentonia robusta, are known from a few sites in southwestern Madagascar (Godfrey and Jungers, 2003b). The body weight of that animal is estimated at approximately 13 kg, four to five times heavier than the living species. However, despite its size, it may have fed upon similar structurally-defended resources (e.g., hard-coated seeds and wood-boring insect larvae; Sterling, 1994b), based upon the elongated incisors and post-cranial skeletal elements that have been found in subfossil remains. Teeth of D. robusta that appear to have been perforated for stringing and used as ornamentation also provide strong evidence that this species was hunted and possibly driven to extinction by humans (MacPhee and Raholimavo, 1988).
The aye-aye has the largest range of any living lemur. Although there have not yet been any studies of possible geographic differentiation among aye-aye populations in different parts of Madagascar, it would not be surprising to find some level of variation—especially given the extraordinary taxonomic diversity that exists in most other lemur genera (C. P. Groves, pers. comm.).
