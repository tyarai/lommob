            "_identification":"The gray mouse lemur has a head-body length of 12–14 cm, a tail length of 13–14.5 cm, a total length of 25–28 cm, and a weight of 58–67 g (Rasoloarison et al., 2000). The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. A pale white patch occurs above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white. The ears are long and fleshy in comparison to the shorter, more concealed ears of Microcebus rufus. This species can be distinguished from the often sympatric Cheirogaleus medius by its smaller size and more active movement, and from Mirza coquereli by its smaller ears and smaller size. Phaner, Lepilemur, and Avahi are all considerably larger and unlikely to be confused with this species. It is sympatric with at least four other mouse lemur species over its large range; for ways to distinguish them, see the accounts for M. griseorufus, M. berthae, M. ravelobensis, and M. tavaratra.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Microcebus murinus inhabits lowland tropical dry forest, sub-arid thorn scrub, gallery forest, spiny forest and secondary forest formations from sea level to 800 m, and is one of Madagascar’s most abundant small native mammals (Radespiel, 2000). Studies at Ankarafantsika indicate that individuals may take shelter in three to nine different tree holes within their range and remain in a given shelter for several days in succession. Females tend to share nests with several conspecifics, while males tend to sleep alone (Radespiel et al., 1998). Two or more females will form breeding groups and raise their young cooperatively (Eberle and Kappeler, 2006). The diet is varied, consisting largely of invertebrates (particularly beetles), but also fruits, flowers, gums, nectar, and small amphibians and reptiles. The Long-eared Owl (Asio madagascariensis) is an important predator of this species (Goodman et al., 1993a). Activity patterns appear to differ between populations and sexes. Males and females at Ankarafantsika exhibit daily, rather than seasonal, torpor (Zimmermann, 1998). At the Kirindy Forest both sexes show the same daily torpor, but most adult females also hibernate for significant periods, while males remain active during these same periods. In fact, the males become extremely active several weeks before the females emerge from their torpor (Schmid and Kappeler, 1998; Rasoazanabary, 2001; Génin, 2003). Recent studies of gray mouse lemur social behavior confirm that male home ranges tend to be twice as large as those of females, and also increase in size during the mating season (Buesching et al., 1998; Radespiel, 2000; Eberle and Kappeler, 2002). Ranges of both sexes overlap, those of females less so than those of males, while the ranges of all members of a “neighborhood” overlap in a central area. Recent genetic studies of M. murinus populations at Kirindy suggest that females tend to arrange themselves spatially in clusters of related individuals, while males tend to emigrate from their natal groups (Wimmer et al., 2002). The mating system is characterized as multi-male/multi-female (Radespiel, 2000; Eberle and Kappeler, 2002, 2004). Females become receptive every 45–55 days from September to March, during which time the male’s testes increase greatly in size. Typically, two young are born after a gestation of approximately 60 days. Although M. murinus is reported to inhabit secondary forests and degraded habitats, at least one recent study suggests that decreased habitat quality may have adverse effects on population dynamics. According to Ganzhorn and Schmid (1998), fewer large tree holes in secondary forests result in fewer opportunities to save energy through periods of torpor, and may increase levels of stress and mortality.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The distribution of M. murinus is currently believed to extend throughout western Madagascar from the Onilahy River in the south to Ankarana in the north. A disjunct population is also found in the southeast up to the littoral forests of the Mandena Conservation Zone. This species is sympatric with M. griseorufus at Beza-Mahafaly, Mikea, and Berenty, with M. berthae in Kirindy Forest, with M. ravelobensis at Ankarafantsika (Rasoloarison et al., 2000; Goodman et al., 2002; Yoder et al., 2002; Kappeler and Rasoloarison, 2003; Ganzhorn and Randrianamalina, 2004; Rasoazanabary, 2004), and with M. tavaratra at Ankarana.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"Microcebus murinus was classified as Least Concern (LC) in the most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008). Loss of habitat for slash-and-burn agriculture and live capture to supply local pet trades are the two most significant threats to this species, the latter being more prominent in the southern and northern parts of its range. It is present in six national parks (Andohahela, Ankarafantsika, Baie de Baly, Isalo, Tsingy de Namoroka, and Zombitse-Vohibasia), six special reserves (Andranomena, Ankarana, Bemarivo, Beza- Mahafaly, Kasijy, and Maningoza), the Berenty Private Reserve, and other privately- protected forests within the Mandena Conservation Zone, as well as in Kirindy Forest (part of the Menabe-Antimena Protected Area). As of 2009, there were about 150 individuals in captivity around the world (ISIS, 2009). This species is still used in a small number of medical laboratories as well (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"With a little patience, this species can be seen easily almost anywhere within its large range. Particularly good opportunities exist at the Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve, the Kirindy Forest, Ankarafantsika National Park, and the Berenty Private Reserve. In Berenty, this species occurs only in the gallery forest, while the adjacent spiny forest is occupied by M. griseorufus. Excursions to Kirindy, which has comfortable bungalows, can be arranged through hotels in Morondava, such as Chez Maggie and the Baobab Hotel. Excursions to Ankarafantsika can easily be arranged through hotels in Mahajanga (= Majunga), or through an Antananarivo-based tour operator. The Ampijoroa campsite has been upgraded recently and now contains the locally managed “Gîte de Ampijoroa” with comfortable rooms and a restaurant. In addition, more upscale chalets have recently opened at Lac Ravelobe across the road.\n",

The anterior portion of the ventral coat is light grayish- white, the posterior portion tending more toward gray.\nAn inhabitant of the spiny forest of southern Madagascar, this species is sympatric in some areas with M. murinus, from which it can readily be distinguished by its more prominent, darker mid-dorsal stripe (Rasoloarison et al., 2000; Goodman et al., 2002; Yoder et al., 2002; Ganzhorn and Randriamanalina, 2004). It is often in the same forests with two other nocturnal genera, Cheirogaleus and Lepilemur, as well, and can easily be distinguished from both of these by its much smaller size and more rapid movements.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Microcebus griseorufus is a common inhabitant of spiny\nforest and dry thorn scrub from sea level to 250 m. In the\nBeza-Mahafaly Special Reserve it is also found in gallery forest, while in the Berenty Private Reserve it is replaced in that habitat by M. murinus (see Rasoazanabary, 2004). In Beza-Mahafaly and in the nearby Ihazoara Valley, both species are among the prey of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and the Madagascar Long-eared Owl (Asio madagascariensis) (Goodman et al., 1993a, 1993b). This species feeds mainly on gums, especially during periods of drought. Daily torpor and opportunistic seasonal fattening have been observed when food availability is high (Génin, 2008).\nThe reproductive season is relatively long, lasting as it does from September to May. Estrus is not synchronized. Mating occurs between September and January. Males have been observed to mate-guard. Gestation in one female lasted 52 days, and litters of up to three have been reported. Alloparenting has been observed. Young males disperse. Females and, less frequently, males associate in same-sex pairs that sometimes combine to form larger sleeping groups (Génin, 2008).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Kollman (1910) described the new subspecies Microcebus minor griseorufus from southern Madagascar. Tattersall (1982) considered it to be a synonym of M. murinus. In a recent review of the genus, Rasoloarison et al. (2000) elevated it to a full species as M. griseorufus. It is found in the spiny forest region of southern and southwestern Madagascar, where it ranges from Lamboharana south to the Toliara (= Tuléar) region, to the Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve (south of the Onilahy River) in the southeast, and to Tsimanampetsotsa, Berenty, and Petriky in the extreme south. At Beza-Mahafaly and Mikea it is sympatric with M. murinus, whereas in Berenty it is found in spiny forest patches but not in the immediately adjacent gallery forest that is occupied by M. murinus.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"Microcebus griseorufus was classified as Least Concern (LC) in the most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008).

Microcebus griseorufus may also be readily observed in the forest called “PK 32” near Ifaty, north of Toliara, and in Tsimanampetsotsa National Park. Night walks at PK 32 are possible from many of the hotels in the Ifaty Mangily coastal tourism area, one hour north of Toliara.

It has a head-body length of 9–9.5 cm, a tail length of 13–14 cm, a total length of 22–23 cm, and it weighs only about 30 g (Rasoloarison et al., 2000). The dorsal coat is rufous with a distinct, darker midline stripe that extends from just behind the shoulders to the tip of the tail. The fur of the head is brighter than that of the back. The ventral coat is pale yellow-brown to pale gray in color. A dull white patch occurs above the nose, the region around the eyes is cinnamon, and the crown and ears are tawny. The ears are very short and the orbits are surrounded by a narrow black band. The furred portions of the hands and feet are dull beige.\nThis species can be confused with the sympatric gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), which is only a little larger, and especially with young M. murinus, which are sometimes “parked” by their mothers. The most reliable characteristic is the warmer rufous back and flanks of Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur, but the difference can be difficult to confirm at night. If a small mouse lemur sits for any length of time, it may be a young “parked” M. murinus, rather than the very active M. berthae.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Dammhahn and Kappeler (2005) describe M. berthae as a solitary forager characterized by extensively overlapping home ranges, those of the males (4.9 ha) being much larger than those of the females (2.5 ha). Daily ranges appear to be significantly greater than (more than double) those of the larger M. murinus. Population densities have been estimated at 30–100 individuals/km2 (Schwab and Ganzhorn, 2004). In addition, while both sexes of M. berthae engage in daily periods of torpor, they do not enter prolonged torpor during the dry season and do not seem to take shelter in tree holes during the day as does M. murinus. The two sympatric mouse lemurs seem to avoid interspecific competition by spatial segregation, making the distributions of both species very patchy (Schwab and Ganzhorn, 2004; Dammhahn and Kappeler, 2008a). In general, M. berthae appears to be more localized than the gray mouse lemur.\nThis tiny primate feeds on fruit and gum, and relies on sugary insect excretions and animal matter during the harsh dry season (Dammhahn and Kappeler, 2008b). Madam Berthe’s lemurs are subject to predation by many different species in the forests where they occur, even more so than the larger M. murinus (M. Dammhahn, pers. comm.).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"West-central Madagascar. M. berthae is the name given to the diminutive, rufous-colored mouse lemur that was discovered in the Kirindy Forest in 1992, and was originally thought to be Microcebus myoxinus (see Schmid and Kappeler, 1994). This species inhabits dry deciduous lowland forests (from sea level to 150 m) in the Menabe region south of the Tsiribihina River, where it is sympatric with the larger Microcebus murinus (see Schmid and Kappeler, 1994; Schwab and Ganzhorn, 2004). In addition to the Kirindy Forest, M. berthae has been reported from the Andranomena Special Reserve (Schwab and Ganzhorn, 2004), and used to occur in the forests of Analabe, just a few kilometers to the northwest (based on a photograph taken in 1985, Fig. 7.15), and in Ambadira. However, the forests of Analabe have been heavily degraded over the past two decades, so it is uncertain if the species still occurs there. Densities in Ambadira tend to be higher than in Kirindy (L. M. Schäffler and P. M. Kappeler, unpubl. data).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified M. berthae as Endangered (EN). Habitat destruction for slash-and-burn agriculture and logging is the principal threat. Its population was estimated at no more than 8,000 mature individuals and it is known from only a handful of forests, most of which are still at risk of destruction and fragmentation\n(Schwab and Ganzhorn, 2004). The recently-established 125,000-ha Menabe-Antimena Protected Area encompasses the 30,000-ha strict conservation zone that includes the Kirindy Forest, and the currently unprotected Ambadira forests, all of which provide protection for this species. It probably still occurs in the Andranomena Special Reserve as well, an old reserve immediately adjacent to the new protected area. It used to occur in the Analabe Private Reserve, but this has now been severely degraded, so it is unclear whether the species still survives there.\nAs of 2009, this species was not being kept in captivity (ISIS, 2009).\n",

An overnight stay at the CNFEREF camp is required to see this and other nocturnal species. The tourist camp, which was constructed here in 1996 and renovated and expanded in 2007, features simple but comfortable bungalows. Reservations should be made at the CNFEREF bureau in Morondava. Both Madame Berthe’s and the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus) can be seen during night walks in close proximity to the camp area, but some trails are much better than others, so a local guide is essential.\n",

The head and forelimbs are reddish- brown, blending into a grayish-brown dorsum and tail, and the underside is grayish-white. A black midline stripe runs the length of the back. The face sports a conspicuous white rostral patch that does not extend past the level of the eyes (Tattersall, 1982). The nose is slightly less prominent than in Microcebus murinus.\nPetter et al. (1977) noted geographic variation in morphology (especially ear size) throughout the range of this species, and Groves (2001) suggested that northern specimens were darker and shorter-tailed than those from the south. Part of the variation that they observed can be accounted for by the identification of new species from within the large range once thought to be occupied by just this one species (see, for example, Louis et al. [2006a], and the descriptions of other new eastern mouse lemur species in this book).\nThis species can be distinguished from Cheirogaleus major, with which it is often sympatric, by its much smaller size and more rapid movements.\n",
            "_natural_history":"As originally described, M. rufus is reported to occur at high densities in tropical moist lowland and montane forests, and sometimes in adjacent secondary forest formations, bamboo forests, old plantations, and even Eucalyptus groves, from sea level to 2,000 m (Ganzhorn, 1987a, 1988; Duckworth et al., 1995; Atsalis, 1999a, 2000). It is omnivorous, subsisting mainly on fruits, but also flowers, insects, gums, and occasionally young leaves (Atsalis, 1998a, 1998b). Fruit of the mistletoe Bakerella, which has a high fat and high fiber content, seems to be a particularly important dietary component, and beetles were the insects most frequently eaten (Atsalis, 1999b). This species is usually seen feeding in shrubs and low trees. Fat storage in the tail seems to be less important than in M. murinus.\nRufous mouse lemur ecology and social behavior have been studied in Ranomafana (Atsalis 1999a, 1999b, 2000). Individuals scent mark with urine and feces, a behavior that helps delimit ranges and communicate presence to conspecifics (Tattersall, 1982). This species sleeps in tree holes and leaf nests during the day, and has even been observed to use old bird’s nests (Martin, 1973; Pollock, 1979b). Predators include the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans), Madagascar Harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), owls, dogs and cats (Goodman et al., 1993c; Langrand and Goodman, 1996).\nMale territories often overlap those of two or more females (Atsalis, 1999a). Mating takes place in September and October, during which time the male’s testes increase significantly in size. One to three young are born following a two-month gestation. During the austral winter, from May through September, most females and some males enter a state of torpor, losing from 5 to 35 g in body weight (Atsalis, 1998a, 1998b, 1999a). Males begin becoming active again in August, while females remain torpid for one or two more months.\nIt should be noted that many of the studies of “Microcebus rufus,” were actually of some of the newly-described taxa, expecially those by Ganzhorn at Analamazaotra Special Reserve (at Andasibe), which are now known to refer to M. lehilahytsara.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Until recently, the geographic range of M. rufus was believed to extend throughout Madagascar’s eastern forests from Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) in the south perhaps as far as the Tsaratanana Massif and just south of the Makira region in the north. However, recent field work and analyses of molecular data have resulted in the identification of several new species within this distribution, including Microcebus lehilahytsara, M. mittermeieri, M. simmonsi, M. jollyae, and M. macarthurii. On top of this, it is likely that still more eastern mouse lemur species will emerge from ongoing studies. These new discoveries have resulted in a significantly reduced range size for M. rufus, and clarification of the ranges of recently-described species are sure to reduce its range still further (Louis et al., 2008). The map for this species gives some indication of what we believe the range of this mouse lemur to be at this time, roughly from Ranomafana National Park to Andringitra National Park (including the corridor between the two sites) in southeastern Madagascar (E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.).\n",

It has a head-body length averaging 25 cm, a tail length of 31–32 cm, a total length of 56–57 cm, and a body weight of 300–320 g (Pagès, 1978; Stanger et al., 1995; Kappeler et al., 2005). The dorsal coat is rich brown or gray-brown, but rose or yellow shades are often found as well. Ventrally, the gray hair base is visible beneath rusty or yellow tips. The tail, which is longer than the body, is thin but has long hair, giving it a slightly “bushy” appearance, and it is darker towards the tip.\nThe large, evident ears, and its quadrupedal running, serve to distinguish Mirza from Cheirogaleus, which has more concealed ears and is slower moving. Mirza can be distinguished from sympatric Microcebus species by its much larger size and very distinctive ears, and from sympatric Lepilemur by its much smaller size, prominent ears, and more rapid quadrupedal movements. Lepilemur is usually far more sedentary and a vertical clinger and leaper, as opposed to a quadrupedal runner. In the Menabe region north of Morondava, and especially in the Kirindy Forest, Mirza is also sympatric with Phaner, another active, medium-sized, nocturnal lemur. There, it can be distinguished from Phaner again by its larger ears and shorter muzzle. Phaner also has a prominent forked pattern on its head, has very loud, distinctive vocalizations, and has a very distinctive habit of head- bobbing. It should be noted, however, that Mirza is highly active, often making it difficult to get a good look and confirm its identity.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Ecological and behavioral studies of M. coquereli have been conducted in the Beroboka, Kirindy, and Marosalaza forests just north of Morondava (Petter et al., 1971; Pagès, 1978, 1980; Kappeler, 1997). Population densities reported from Marosalaza range from 30 individuals/km2 (Hladik et al., 1980) to 50 individuals/km2 (Petter et al., 1971) but, in the latter study, reached as high as 210 individuals/km2 in forests running along rivers. Ausilio and Raveloarinoro (1993) recorded densities of 100 individuals/km2 in the forests of Tsimembo, while Kappeler (1997) recorded 120 individuals/km2 in Kirindy. However, the latter population underwent an inexplicable decline after remaining steady for several years (Markolf et al., 2008b).Home ranges of 1 to 4 ha overlap extensively and all individuals studied seem to make heavy use of smaller core areas, which they defend aggressively (Pagès, 1978, 1980; Kappeler, 1997). Male ranges tend to overlap those of several females as well as those of other males. In the Kirindy Forest, their ranges more than quadruple in the mating season (Kappeler, 1997, 2003). Males interact positively (grooming, contact calling) with females when they make contact, and pairs travel together for short periods even during the dry season.\nCoquerel’s giant mouse lemur is typically solitary when foraging, and does not nest communally. It spends its daytime hours in a spherical nest of up to 50 cm in diameter (Kappeler, 2003), usually placed 2–10 m high in the fork of a large branch or among dense lianas (to discourage predators), and constructed of interlaced lianas, branches, leaves, and twigs chewed off from nearby trees (Petter et al., 1971; Pagès, 1980; Sarikaya and Kappeler, 1997). Pagès (1980) and Kappeler (1997) found only females and their offspring sharing nests. Each individual uses as many as 10 or 12 nests, changing its sleeping site every few days (Kappeler, 2003). Individuals leave the nest around dusk, at which time they begin feeding or self- grooming, or continue resting. Travel and foraging usually occur at heights of 5 to 10 m, though M. coquereli does come to the ground on occasion (Kappeler, 2003). During the latter half of the night they are more likely to be involved in social activities (Pagès, 1978, 1980). While they are likely to return to the nest for the second half of the night during the cold winter, they remain active year round and do not enter into a state of torpor. Some may make “loud calls,” usually at the beginning of their nightly activity, and they make soft hon calls while moving about (Kappeler, 2003). Individuals scent-mark objects using saliva, urine or anogenital secretions (Petter and van der Sloot, 2000).\nCoquerel’s giant mouse lemur is omnivorous, feeding on fruits, flowers, buds, gums, insects, insect excretions, and spiders, frogs, chameleons, and small birds (Pagès, 1980). It may even prey on smaller Microcebus species (Goodman, 2003). Another seemingly important food source during the dry season (June–July) are the excretions of cochineal and homopteran larvae (Pagès, 1980).\nBased on the results of comparative studies, reproductive activity of M. coquereli in the Kirindy Forest begins in November (Pagès, 1978, 1980; Kappeler, 2003). Gestation lasts about three months (Petter-Rousseaux, 1980) and two infants (occasionally one) leave the nest after about three weeks. The young are carried in their mother’s mouth for several weeks and are left in vegetation while she forages (Stanger et al., 1995; Kappeler, 1998). After three months infants forage alone, but maintain vocal contact with the mother (Pagès, 1980, 1983).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Coquerel’s giant mouse lemur is found in lowland dry forests of western Madagascar, from sea level to 700 m (Petter et al., 1971; Kappeler et al., 2005). Its distribution is best described as patchy, reflecting the fragmentation of the forests throughout this region. One nucleus is in the southwest between the Onilahy River in the south and the Tsiribinha River in the north, including Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park (Ganzhorn, 1994) and Isalo National Park (Hawkins, 1999). To the north of the Tsiribihina River, Mirza has also been reported from the the Andranomena Special Reserve and Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park (Kappeler, 2003), and recent sightings confirm its presence in Tsingy de Namoroka National Park as well (S. M. Goodman, pers. comm.). For the present, these disjunct populations are attributed to M. coquereli. Still farther north, M. zaza inhabits the Sambirano region.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified M. coquereli as Near Threatened (NT). It appears to be adaptable, can survive in secondary forest, and occurs in fairly high densities in some parts of its range (Petter et al., 1977). This species is believed to be present in two national parks (Tsingy de Bemaraha and Zombitse-Vohibasia), the Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve, the Andranomena Special Reserve, the Kirindy Forest (part of the Menabe-Antimena Protected Area), and the Ampataka Classified Forest (Mittermeier et al., 1994; Ganzhorn, 1994).\nAccording to ISIS (2009), there were about half a dozen individuals of this species in captivity in the United States and Europe. However, it would appear that they are all, in fact, examples of Mirza zaza (A. Katz, pers. comm.), and in any event are a non-breeding population (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.).\n",

Mirza zaza is also sympatric with Phaner parienti, another active, medium- sized, nocturnal lemur. Phaner has a prominent forked pattern on its head and has very loud, distinctive vocalizations. It should be noted, however, that Mirza is highly active, often making it difficult to get a good look to confirm an identification.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Andrianarivo (1981) and Kappeler (1997) have recorded\nhigh population densities for M. zaza. Indeed, their estimates of 385 individuals/km2 and 1,086 individuals/km2 are several times higher than those obtained for M. coquereli in the Kirindy Forest. The concentration of animals in more isolated forest fragments and the presence of mango, cashew, and other introduced food tree species in the Ambato region may help explain the higher densities (Markolf et al., 2008a).\nThis species is typically solitary, choosing to forage alone. It spends daytime hours in a spherical nest of up to 50 cm in diameter, usually placed 2–10 m high in the fork of a\nlarge branch or among dense lianas (to discourage predators), and constructed of interlaced lianas, branches, leaves, and twigs chewed off nearby trees. It would seem that they are more social nesters than M. coquereli. Kappeler (2003) found nests in Ambanja with adult males, females and young, and an average occupancy of four individuals (Kappeler et al., 2005). Markolf et al. (2008a) also found that they showed more social tendencies than is typical of M. coquereli (perhaps associated with higher recorded densities) and were also more vocal.\nMirza zaza is omnivorous, feeding on fruits, flowers, buds, gums, insects, insect secretions, spiders, frogs, chameleons, and small birds. Cashew fruits are an important food source during the dry season (June–July).\nReproductive activity in M. zaza, based on studies of animals from the Ambanja region (Kappeler et al., 2005), begins in August, several months earlier than when M. coquereli begins to mate in the Kirindy Forest of southwestern Madagascar (Pagès, 1978, 1980; Kappeler, 2003).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Type specimens for M. zaza come from the region of the Ampasindava Peninsula in northwestern Madagascar, specifically from Ambato and Pasandava. It is known to occur between the rivers Mahavavy Nord and Maeverano in the northwest of the island (between Manehoko in the north and Ankaibe in the south) (Markolf et al., 2008a). Christoph Schwitzer (pers. obs.) has recorded it in the Sahamalaza region in the Anakarafa Forest. Sightings attributed to M. coquereli in the Mahalaka Forest (Randrianambinina et al., 2003c) and in Ankarafa, Andranobe and Ambendrana (Randriatahina and Rabarivola, 2004) are probably M. zaza (see Markolf et al., 2008a). Populations from the Befotaka region a bit farther to the south may also be this species (Randriatahina and Rabarivola, 2004), but this remains uncertain.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"There is insufficient information to determine the conservation status of M. zaza, so the latest IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified it as Data Deficient (DD). However, given that M. coquereli is currently listed as Near Threatened (NT), M. zaza must be considered at least as threatened (Markolf et al., 2008a) and could very well be Endangered. Kappeler et al. (2005) described its type locality as a highly degraded forest of only about 4 ha. A subsequent visit in 2007 by Markolf et al. (2008a) found that the forest had been almost entirely eliminated. They did see M. zaza there (four individuals in 20 minutes of walking), but they concluded that the extirpation of the population was only a matter of time. Markolf et al. (2008a) visited a further four sites in search of this species—Ankiabe, Andranobe, Ambendrana and Ankarafa. At Ankiabe, they saw a few individuals in a degraded 4-5 km forest along a hillside near the River Maevarano. The forests at Andranobe and Ambendrana were very small and similarly degraded but with many mango trees. There they were able to see M. zaza with some ease. The forest at Ankarafa was better preserved and they were able to confirm their presence there, although in fewer numbers than at Andranobe and Ambendrana, concluding that the mango trees were an important food source in the degraded forests. This species is known to occur in two national parks, Tsingy de Namoroka and Sahamalaza-Iles Radama (U. Radespiel, pers. comm.), and in the protected area at Ankarafa (Markolf et al., 2008a). Markolf et al. (2008a) concluded that the range of M. zaza is limited to just a few highly degraded forest fragments, and that, even though individuals are regularly seen together, population densities are low in all of them.\nAccording to ISIS, as of 2009 this species was not represented in captivity. However, it would appear that the half-dozen speciemens of Mirza in the United States and Europe, currently being exhibited as M. coquereli, are in fact M. zaza (A. Katz, pers. comm.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"Mirza zaza is easily seen in secondary forests near Ambanja, especially in abandoned cashew orchards. It can also be readily viewed in forest right next to the town of Benavony, about 6 km from Ambanja, and in the Andoke-Be Forest right at the edge of the Manongarivo Special Reserve (R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.). The Benavony Forest is also very good for Hapalemur occidentalis.\n",

It has a head-body length of 13–16 cm, a tail length of 14–20 cm, a total length of 27–36 cm, and a body weight of 65–90 g (Meier and Albignac, 1991; Biebouw, 2009). The most obvious external character is the long tufted hair around the ears. The dorsal coat is a rosy brownish-gray and the ventral coat is light gray. The long tail is the same color as the body, becoming darker and bushier at its end. Dark rings surround the eyes, and there is sometimes a pale white stripe that extends between the eyes and the tip of the nose.\nThis lemur is comparable in size to Microcebus and smaller than Cheirogaleus. Distinguishing this small animal from eastern Microcebus in the field can be quite difficult, unless one is close enough to get a good look at the ear tufts or actually has the animal in hand.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Relatively little was known about the behavior and ecology of the hairy-eared dwarf lemur until recently (Biebouw, 2009; Biebouw et al., 2009). It is nocturnal and has been observed in pairs (presumably male and female) with offspring, as well as singly. It appears to have much larger home ranges (5.4–15.4 ha) than other Cheirogaleidae (Biebouw, 2009). Groups of two to six nest in holes of larger trees and prefer to line the nest with dry plant material, even covering themselves with it in captivity (Meier and Albignac, 1991). Individuals use from four to five tree holes, showing high nest fidelity (Biebouw et al., 2009). Additionally, the species has been seen to share a tree hole with white-tailed tree rats (Brachytarsomys albicauda) (Biebouw et al., 2009). Individuals are often seen in tangles of brush or lianas, and evidently forage at lower levels in the forest. The teeth and nails suggest a gum-eating diet, and the long tongue is suited for gathering nectar. Indeed, this lemur prefers fruit, insects and honey in captivity. Insectivory has been observed in the wild, along with feeding on gums, primarily of Terminalia (Biebouw, 2009). According to earlier reports, prior to undergoing aestivation in the cooler, less rainy austral winter (May/June–September/October), A. trichotis accumulates large amounts of fat and its body weight peaks at about 140% of the minimum (Rakotoarison et al., 1997). During this supposed torpor, it is said to consume most of its fat reserves, but emerges ready to breed. However, more recent research indicates that Allocebus does not, in fact, undergo periods of torpor at all. Moreover, these same researchers did not observe significant weight being gained prior to the winter months (Biebouw, 2009; E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.). We still have much to learn about this unusual animal.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The range of A. trichotis is still not well known, although it has become clearer over the past 20 years. Up until 1989, animals had been sighted only along the Mananara River and the species was thought to be restricted to lowland rain forests of that area (Meier and Albignac, 1991). Since 1994, however, its presence has been documented in Marojejy National Park (Goodman and Raselimanana, 2002), Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve (Schütz and Goodman, 1998; Schmid and Smolker, 1998), Masoala National Park (Sterling and Rakotoarison, 1998), Mananara-Nord National Park, the Marotandrano Special Reserve (J. Ralison, pers. comm.), Zahamena Strict Nature Reserve (Rakotoarison, 1995a, 1995b), Analamazaotra Special Reserve (Garbutt, 2001; R. A. Mittermeier, pers.obs.), Maromizaha Forest (J. Zaonarivelo, pers. comm.), Vohidrazana Forest (Rakotoarison et al., 1997), Ambavoty Classified Forest (E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.), and the forests of Vohimana (N. Garbutt, pers. comm.). Overall, sightings have been few (probably no more than a few dozen in total).\nThe species appears to be very rare wherever it occurs, with an estimated 11–19 individuals per km2 in the one study that has been conducted (Biebouw, 2009). Allocebus has mostly been found in intact tropical moist lowland and mid-altitude forest up to 1,000 m, but some populations appear to occur in montane forests (e.g., the Marotandrano Special Reserve) up to 1,600 m. It also seems to tolerate moderate levels of human activity (Schütz and Goodman, 1998).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"Allocebus trichotis was classified as Data Deficient (DD) in the most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008). Threats include destruction of eastern rain forest habitat, as well as hunting and trapping in certain regions (Yoder, 1996). Fortunately, this species is known to occur in at least five national parks (Mananara-Nord, Mantadia, Marojejy, Masoala, and Zahamena), the Zahamena Strict Nature Reserve, and three special reserves (Analamazaotra, Anjanaharibe-Sud, and Marotandrano). Range-wide surveys are needed to assess population densities and conservation status, and more detailed field studies should also be carried out to complement the single in-depth study by Biebouw (2009). In addition, a detailed long-term study of this species would be highly desirable to gain a better understanding of its behavior and ecology.\nAs of 2009, this species was not being kept in captivity (ISIS, 2009).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"Under normal circumstances, this is one of the most difficult lemurs to find in the wild. Indeed many experts who have worked for decades in Madagascar have yet to see one. If you are lucky enough to catch what you think is one in your flashlight beam, you will have to get close enough to see the hair on its ears to be sure it is actually A. trichotis. Currently, the best opportunity for viewing it is at Andasibe (Perinét), in the Mitsinjo-managed section of the forest. There, in recent years, a particular individual Allocebus religiously visits a Terminalia tree virtually every night to eat gum. You can get to within a couple of meters or so of the animal as it feeds low down on the tree. This Allocebus is very regular in its habits, and appears to only visit the Terminalia between 19:00 and 19:45 hrs. One can, therefore, be reasonably sure of seeing it by staking out this tree over two or three nights (G. Davies, pers. comm.). Other places for viewing this species are at the Analamazaotra Special Reserve itself and the Forêt de Vohidrazana near the village of Fanovana, about 12 km east of Andasibe (Rakotoarison et al., 1997), although its observation in these areas remains very unpredictable. The recent unfortunate policy of closing government reserves to night walks makes seeing nocturnal species in protected areas such as Analamazaotra very difficult, and we hope that the government will soon drop this unnecessary and counter-productive policy in the near future. However, this policy does not affect private areas such as Mitsinjo and Vohidrazana.\n",

            "_identification":"The fat-tailed dwarf lemur is one of the smaller members of the genus Cheirogaleus. Head-body length is 17–23 cm, tail length is 19–27 cm, total length is 40–50 cm, and body weight varies seasonally from 120 to 270 g (Petter, 1978; Fietz and Ganzhorn, 1999; Müller, 1999b; Groves, 2000). According to Groves (2000), the dorsal coat is a light frosted fawn-gray with a brown midline stripe. The ventral coat is creamy or yellowish, somewhat more yellow toward the median. There is a partial but sharply marked white collar that extends well up the sides of the neck. A white median facial stripe is offset by dark brown eye rings. The hands and feet are white.\nIn his revision of the genus, Groves (2000) considered populations from the tropical dry lowland forests and spiny forest regions of the southwest to be a distinct species, and resurrected the name Cheirogaleus adipicaudatus (A. Grandidier, 1868). In terms of morphology, this taxon was said to be similar to C. medius, but with less contrasting colors and a tail that was longer than the head-body length. Groves (2000) examined specimens from three southern Madagascar sites: Tabiky, Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin), and a third unnamed location 170 km east of Toliara (= Tuléar). Most likely representing a collection in dry spiny forest to the west of Tolagnaro. The presence of C. adipicaudatus in the region of Tolagnaro was not supported by Hapke et al. (2005), whose findings indicated instead the presence of three other Cheirogaleus species from that region (C. crossleyi, C. major and C. medius). It may be that the features on which this species was differentiated from C. medius (see Groves, 2001) characterize only a particular population of restricted distribution (C. P. Groves, pers. comm.). In any case, as indicated above, we follow Groeneveld et al. (2009) in considering C. adipicaudatus a synonym of C. medius. Groeneveld et al. (2009) found five terminal clades within C. medius, however, which may turn out to be distinct species.\nIn the field, Cheirogaleus is most likely to be confused with Lepilemur or Mirza, and possibly Microcebus, although it tends to move more slowly than any of these three. It can be distinguished from Lepilemur by its distinctive lighter underparts, by the form of its tail, and by body posture and movement; Lepilemur is more likely to adopt a vertical posture and to leap, whereas Cheirogaleus walks slowly and quadrupedally (although it is capable of leaping as well). Sportive lemurs are three to eight times the size of C. medius. Mirza has large distinctive ears and moves both rapidly and constantly. Microcebus also has highly visible ears, moves more than does Cheirogaleus, and is much smaller. Confusion with Phaner is unlikely, since Phaner moves constantly, vocalizes loudly, bobs its head back and forth, and has a more elongate face and telltale fork-mark pattern on its head. Distinguishing among species of Cheirogaleus is possible through the geographic location and using the detailed descriptions found in this section.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Cheirogaleus medius inhabits dry deciduous forests at densities estimated to range from 40 to 400 individuals/ km2 (Hladik et al., 1980; Fietz, 1999a). Individual home ranges are 1–2 ha. Territories are defended, and marked using feces (Schilling, 1980; Ganzhorn and Kappeler, 1996; Fietz, 1999a). Small family groups consist of the reproductively-active pair and their offspring from one or two breeding seasons (Fietz, 1999b; Müller, 1999a). Despite the family structure, about 40% of the offspring are fathered range, and local populations a few kilometers apart can vary greatly in population density and sex ratio (Fredstedt et al., 2007). Fruits, flowers and seeds are dietary staples, with invertebrates being eaten in small amounts and small vertebrates taken on occasion. Gums and insect excretions round out the diet. Daylight hours are spent in tree holes, with up to five individuals occupying a single shelter (Petter, 1978).\nThe most notable characteristic of this species and other members of the genus Cheirogaleus is the ability to become torpid for six months or more during the austral winter, a time of food and water scarcity (Pagès and Petter-Rousseaux, 1980; Fietz, 2003; Dausmann et al., 2004). In preparation for the dry season, animals begin to eat greater quantities of fruits with high sugar content and to accumulate significant quantities of fat, much of it stored in the tail. Individuals enter the same tree holes used as daily shelters and\nremain totally inactive during prolonged hibernation. Unlike other hibernating mammals, the body temperatures of torpid dwarf lemurs do not remain lower and stable, but closely track ambient temperatures (Dausmann et al. 2000, 2004). Emergence from torpor typically occurs just before the seasonal rains in November. Body mass may decline by more than half during this period. The return to an active state also stimulates the onset of mating behavior, resulting in births a couple of months later. Litter sizes range from one to four, but twins are the most common and the young are born covered with fur and with eyes open (Foerg, 1982b). As the next dry season draws near, juvenile dwarf lemurs tend to remain active about a month longer than do adults. Sexual maturity is reached during the second year of life.\nPredators of C. medius include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the boas Sanzinia madagascariensis and Acrantophis madagascariensis, the Madagascar Harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), the Madagascar Buzzard (Buteo madagascariensis), and the owls Tyto alba and Asio madagascariensis (Goodman and Langrand, 1996a; Gilbert and Tingay, 2001; Goodman, 2003).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"When C. medius was one of only two recognized dwarf\nlemur species, it was believed to occur throughout the west\nand south of Madagascar, from Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin)\nin the southeast, west through the southern spiny desert to\nthe southwestern side of the island, and then north along\nthe western dry deciduous forest as far as the Sambirano\nregion. It was also reported from several scattered northern\nsites such as Ambilobe, Ankarana, and Daraina (Nicoll\nand Langrand, 1989; Mittermeier et al., 1994). Groves\n(2000), in his revision of the genus, limited the range of\nthis species to the dry forests of western Madagascar, with\nC. adipicaudatus in the southern spiny desert. Subsequent\nfield studies and genetic analyses have now eliminated C.\nadipicaudatus as a valid species, and have again extended\nthe range of C. medius into the southern spiny desert and all\nthe way east to the evergreen humid forest of Sainte-Luce,\n40 km northeast of Tolagnaro in extreme southeastern\nMadagascar (Hapke et al., 2005). In the southeast, C. medius\nalso occurs in the littoral forests of Petriky and Mandena,\nand in humid forest remnants in the Lavasoa-Ambatotsirongorongo mountains (west of Fort-Dauphin) (A. Hapke, pers.comm.). Cheirogaleus major is also known from Mandena\n￼￼and possibly occurs in Sainte Luce as well (A. Hapke, pers.comm.). Groeneveld et al. (2009, 2010) further confirm that this species occurs in the Tolagnaro region in the southeast, and also in the region of the Bay of Pasandava (north of the Ampasindava Peninsula) in the northwest. In addition, it extends as far northwest as Ankarana and in at least two sites in the northeast, Bekaraoka and Sambava, and it may be the species present in the Daraina area in the northeast, but this remains to be confirmed (Mittermeier et al., 1994).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified C. medius as Least Concern (LC). Although it is an apparently widespread and abundant species at present, the discovery of new species within its formerly broad range will affect its overall status and some of the new taxa may be Endangered. It is reported from seven national parks (Andohahela, Ankarafantsika, Ankarana, Baie de Baly, Tsimanampetsotsa, Tsingy de Namoroka, and Zombitse-Vohibasia) and four special reserves (Andranomena, Bemarivo, Beza-Mahafaly and Maningoza), as well as in the Kirindy Forest (part of the Menabe-Antimena Protected Area), in Daraina (Loky-Manambato Protected Area), and in the Sainte-Luce Private Reserve (O’Connor et al., 1986; Harcourt and Thornback, 1990; Feistner and Schmid, 1999).\nAccording to ISIS, there are approximately 50 individuals of what are considered to be Cheirogaleus medius in captivity in the USA and in Europe (ISIS, 2009).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The fat-tailed dwarf lemur can be seen in many places throughout its range, but usually only in the rainy season (October through April). Particularly good sites for viewing it are the Kirindy Forest (Menabe-Antimena Protected Area) in the southwest, Ankarafantsika National Park in the northwest, and the dry forest near Daraina (Loky-Manambato Protected Area) in northeastern Madagascar, where it seems to be particularly abundant. Visits to Daraina are now being arranged by a number of international tour operators, mainly for seeing Tattersall’s sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli).\nIn southern Madagascar, the best locations for viewing what we believe to be this species of Cheirogaleus are the Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve to the east of Toliara (= Tuléar), Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, and Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park, which can be reached by car from Toliara in about two hours. The latter is also a good location for seeing the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) and Verreaux’s sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Andohahela National Park’s dry forest parcels also offer opportunities to see dwarf lemurs during nocturnal walks. The park has excellent trails and camping facilities.

This species was first described by Forsyth Major in 1896, but subsequently considered a junior synonym of C. major. Groves (2000) resurrected this species based on four skins in museum collections (the type specimen in the British Museum, a skin from Imerina in the Humboldt Museum, Berlin, and two specimens from Pasandava Bay, north of the Ampisandava Peninsula, in Naturalis (the Rijksmuseum in Leiden). No more recent information was available concerning its range in the wild until the species was identified in a small patch of forest in Tsinjoarivo by Blanco et al. (2009). Blanco et al. (2009) measured 15 individuals: head-body length with a mean of 21.8 ±0.9 cm (range 20.5–23.5 cm), tail length 23.5 cm ±1.3 cm (range 22.0– 26.5 cm), and body mass with a mean of 272.1 ±35.6 g (range 219.0–359.5 g).\nThis species has gray-fawn fur on the dorsum and cap, with or without a darker dorsal median line (see Fig. 7.64). There is light gray or creamy fur (with whitish tips and darker roots) on the ventrum, this lighter coloration continuing cranially as bands extending onto the sides of the neck, but not the back, though it does extend up the flanks and along the outsides of the thighs. The orbits are surrounded by distinct, broad and very black eye rings. There may be thin extensions of this black coloration (or none at all) delineating the sides of the muzzle, but the dominant color of the muzzle is only slightly grayer than the dorsal fur and very uniform, and the rhinarium tends to be pink. The ears are naked, and the pinnae are dark with sparse hair on their inner and outer surfaces. The hands and feet are pink ventrally and gray-brown dorsally (Blanco et al., 2009; M. Blanco, pers. comm.; see also Groves, 2000).\n",

            "_geographic_range":"This species was long known only from museum specimens collected from three localities in Madagascar’s Central Domain (Groves, 2000). The type locality, Ankeramadinika, a “day’s journey east of Antananarivo” (Groves, 2000), is just east of the Mangoro River, 1,408 m above sea level (Blanco et al., 2009; Groeneveld et al., 2010). Blanco et al. (2009) recorded sympatric dwarf lemurs about 100 km south of Ankeramadinika, in the mid- and high-altitude forests of the Tsinjoarivo region, a forest block isolated by two rivers (the Onive in the south and the Mangoro in the east) and bounded by the high-altitude central plateau in the west. They identified C. crossleyi in extensive forest at a site called Vatateza at about 1,390 m above sea level, and (tentatively at the time) C. sibreei, in a forest patch of 228 km2 at Andasivodihazo at about 1,660 m above sea level. Blanco et al. (2009) based their identifications on morphometric traits. Subsequent molecular genetic studies by Groeneveld et al. (2010) confirmed their conclusion: “the individuals from Andasivodihazo are distinct from C. medius, C. major and C. crossleyi and thus represent a fourth species” (p.10). Groeneveld et al. (in press) carried out further morphometric analyses of the Andasivodihazo dwarf lemurs, comparing them with the C. sibreei holotype in the British Museum, and concluded that they were indeed the same species.\nAs reported by Groeneveld et al. (2010), three localities were sampled at Tsinjoarivo on two occasions between 2006 and 2009. Cheirogaleus crossleyi was subsequently also found at Andasivodihazo, and C. sibreei alone was recorded at a nearby site called Ankadivory at about 1,470 m above sea level. They indicated that C. sibreei may be restricted by the Onive and Mangoro rivers, Anjozorobe, and the corridor to the western half of the Tsinjoarivo forest above 1,400 m altitude, in an area of less than 2,000 km2. Rasolofoson et al. (2007a, 2007b) reported it far to the north, in the Makira Forest. It seems that this locality is a rather large range extension, and it may be that a closely related species, thus far undescribed, is involved (C. P. Groves, pers. comm.). Groeneveld et al. (2010) determined that the Naturalis material from Pasandava Bay examined by Groves (2000), was aligned, morphometrically and genetically, with C. medius, not C. sibreei.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The latest IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified C. sibreei as Data Deficient (DD). Its range may well be the smallest of the dwarf lemurs. Furthermore, if, as Groeneveld et al. (2010) surmised, it occurs only at higher altitudes (above about 1,400 m), it may be restricted to just a very few subpopulations along the western margin of the eastern rain forest corridor between the Onive and Mangoro rivers. Groeneveld et al. (2010) reported on the status of these forests. While the lower parts near the plateau escarpment are remote and reasonably undisturbed, the higher areas are flatter, continuous with the plateau, and broadly accessible to “substantial human settlement.” The forest cover in this western part of Tsinjoarivo has been reduced to about half its original extent, and is highly fragmented (Irwin, 2006). As reported by Groeneveld et al. (2010), the forest there is slated for future protection, but there are as yet no safeguards to ensure its permanence. Habitat loss and fragmentation could well be a threat to its survival.\nAs of 2010, this species was not being kept in captivity (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The only site where we know with certainty that this species can be found is Andasivodihazo, in the Tsinjoarivo region. However, this location is difficult to reach, and we do not recommend it for first time visitors to Madagascar.\n",

Its head-body length is 23–25 cm, tail length 25–28 cm, total length 50–55 cm, and its body weight averages 350–400 g, with a seasonal variation from 250 to 500 g (Fietz, 2003). The dorsal coat is gray-brown, and the ventral coat is gray. The dark reddish dorsal midline stripe, when present, is not very distinct. The mid-facial zone is pale and lacks a distinct stripe. This lighter region does not extend above the level of the eyes, the eye rings themselves are not distinct, and the snout is dark. The ears are naked. As indicated above in the generic description for Cheirogaleus, Groeneveld et al. (2009) found three terminal clades within C. major, which may well turn out to be distinct species. Cheirogaleus major may easily be confused with other sympatric species of Cheirogaleus in the few places where such sympatry occurs (see below).\n",
            "_natural_history":"Cheirogaleus major is an inhabitant of Madagascar’s eastern lowland and montane forests (sea level to 1800 m), where conditions of water and food availability are not as seasonally severe as in the drier western deciduous forests. Nonetheless, the greater dwarf lemur does prepare for hibernation by storing excess fat in its tail, perhaps taking up, as much as 30% of its total body mass. Also, as is the case with C. medius, C. major hibernates in tree holes and hollows (Wright and Martin, 1995). Relatively little is known of the social behavior of C. major. Home ranges of adult females extend up to 4 ha, and appear to include those of adult males and juveniles as well. Sleeping groups of up to three adult animals have been observed both in tree holes and clumps of vegetation. Population densities have been estimated at 75–110 individuals/km2 (Pollock, 1979b). However, it should be noted that a number of these observations, cited here and below, were made in Andasibe (= Périnet), which would mean that they refer to C. crossleyi under the new taxonomic arrangement of Groves (2000).\nMating behavior ensues shortly after emergence from torpor in October and November, females giving birth to two to three infants in January after a gestation of about 70 days (Petter-Rousseaux, 1964). Young are born in leaf nests constructed by the females 6–12 m above the ground. Newborn greater dwarf lemurs are born furred but with eyes closed. They are first carried in their mother’s mouth, but soon cling to the fur on her back (Fietz, 2003).\nCheirogaleus major feeds mainly on nectar, fruits, young leaves, and buds, with insect prey constituting only a minor part of the diet (Ganzhorn, 1988; Wright and Martin, 1995). Nectar seems to be a particularly important food item just after it emerges from hibernation, and studies suggest that C. major may be an important pollinator for at least one species of liana (Nilson et al., 1993). Predators of C. major include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans), and the Madagascar tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis) (Goodman, 2003).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"According to the most recent information from Groeneveld et al. (2009), C. major is found in eastern lowland rain forest from the southeastern tip of Madagascar near Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) as far north as Maroantsetra. The southern limit of its distribution is particularly interesting, since C. medius and C. crossleyi can also be found the same general region, although not to date in the same forests (Hapke et al., 2005). Andreas Hapke has found C. major in the humid forests of the Vohimena and Anosy mountains and the littoral forest at Mandena, and believes it might also occur in Sainte Luce, but this has yet to be confirmed (pers. comm.). Cheirogaleus crossleyi and C. medius, on the other hand, occur in humid forest remnants in the Lavasoa-Ambatotsirongorongo mountains (west of Fort- Dauphin), and C. medius also in the littoral forests of Petriky, Mandena and Sainte Luce. Cheirogaleus major is sympatric with C. crossleyi in Ranomafana National Park (P. C. Wright, pers. comm.).\n",

J. Porton, pers. comm.).\n",

(2010) recorded it at Talatakely and Vatateza and, sympatric with C. sibreei, at Andasivodihazo. Cheirogaleus crossleyi is also sympatric with C. major in Ranomafana National Park (P. C. Wright, pers. comm.). Localities in the northeast include Sambava, Manatenina, and Vohémar (Groeneveld et al., 2009, 2010). According to Hapke et al.

Population density\nestimates derived from studies in the Kirindy Forest and\nfrom Marosalaza are consistent at about 50–70 individuals/km2 (Charles-Dominique and Petter, 1980), but Ausilio and Raveloarinoro (1993) estimated densities of 300–400 individuals/km2 in the forests of Tsimembo. Family groups, consisting of an adult pair and their offspring, occupy and defend territories ranging from 3–10 ha (Schülke, 2003a), but the adults spend very little time together (Schülke and Kappeler, 2003). The male has a large cutaneous throat gland (see Fig. 7.79), which he rubs on the head, shoulders, and the back of the female in a stereotypical manner during social grooming (Charles- Dominique and Petter, 1980; Ganzhorn and Kappeler, 1996). To avoid competition with other nocturnal lemurs, this species tends to use the highest sleeping sites, taking shelter in tree holes and leaf nests constructed by the sympatric Mirza coquereli (Kappeler, 2003; Schülke, 2003a). Phaner pallescens has an unusual diet with a high percentage of tree exudates. It is well adapted to its specialized diet, having a long tongue, an elongated cecum and nearly horizontal lower front incisors and canines that serve as scrapers. At Kirindy, two species of Terminalia trees provide the bulk of the exudates eaten by Phaner. Apparently, this food provides a good source of protein, to the point that invertebrate prey is not sought to the same degree that it is by other cheirogaleids (Hladik et al., 1980). Females appear to be dominant to males in terms of access to feeding sites. Predators of P. pallescens include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the Madagascar Buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the Madagascar Cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) (Rasoloarison et al., 1995; Goodman, 2003). Schülke (2003a) believes that Madagascar Harrier-hawks (Polyboroides radiatus) take Phaner from their sleeping holes, using their long legs to investigate hollow trees and crevices (Langrand, 1990; Gilbert and Tingay, 2001).\nCommunication within and between groups is largely vocal and frequent. At least four different types of calls have been identified (Charles-Dominique and Petter, 1980). Females tend to be dominant in contacts with strange males from neighboring groups (Schülke, 2003a). Fork-marked lemurs generally leave their sleeping sites just before dusk and they are most active (including vocalizing) in the first hour after sunset. Early studies of Phaner reproductive behavior (Petter et al., 1971, 1975) suggest a much earlier onset of mating activities than those more recently observed by Schülke (2003a), but a single infant appears to be born during the austral summer.\n",

It inhabits lowland forests from sea level to 800 m. Fork-marked lemurs have also been recorded calling in and around Parcel 2 of Andohahela National Park in the southeast of the country, but it is not known whether the form in question is P. pallescens, Phaner furcifer, or an undescribed species (Feistner and Schmid, 1999).\n",

It takes shelter during the day in tangles of vines and leaves during the wet season. L. mustelinus is solitary and eats leaves, flowers, and fruits (Ganzhorn, 1988).

            "_geographic_range":"This species occurs in a handful of tiny, tropical dry forest fragments in extreme northeastern Madagascar, just to the south of Antsiranana (= Diégo-Suarez). It was formerly believed to inhabit both dry and humid forests from the Montagne d’Ambre region south to the Mahavavy River near Ambilobe in the west, and probably to the Fanambana River south of Vohémar in the east (Ratsirarson and Rumpler, 1988; Hawkins et al., 1990; Mittermeier et al., 1994; Ravaoarimanana et al., 2004). However, with the recognition of L. ankaranensis as a distinct species, the range of L. septentrionalis was reduced to a handful of very small remnant forest patches near the villages of Madirobe and Ankarongana in the Sahafary region, and in the immediate vicinity of Andrahona, a small mountain rising out of the surrounding lowlands about 30 km south of Antsiranana and east of RN6 (Y. Rumpler, pers. comm.; R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.). As a result, it must be considered one of the most restricted and least protected lemurs in Madagascar, and probably the one closest to extinction. Recent faunal surveys in the Montagne des Français, a calcareous massif of about 6,114 ha approximately 12 km south east of Antsiranana (= Diégo-Suarez), listed L. septentrionalis as one of the species occurring there (D’Cruze et al., 2007; Sabel et al., 2009), but we are not sure if it is actually L. septentrionalis or the more wide-ranging L. ankaranensis. This remains to be determined, and doing so should be a high priority.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"Lepilemur septentrionalis is listed as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List (2008). Its population is unknown, but likely to be extremely small. The principal threats are habitat destruction for Eucalyptus plantations, collection of firewood, and charcoal production, and perhaps also hunting for food. Most of its habitat is already gone, and it does not occur in any official protected areas. What is more, it is uncertain whether any of the forest patches in which it still survives would be of sufficient size to warrant creation of a protected area. It was listed as one of the world’s 25 Most endangered primates in 2008 (Ravaorimanana et al., 2009). Total numbers are unknown but, taking into account its limited distribution in the forests of Sahafary, Andrahona and Andranomadiro, probably only about 100-150 individuals remain. Surveys of five areas in 2007 provided the following population estimates: 1) Area of Andrahona (forest patches and gallery forests of Andrahona, Analajanana, and Analanjavavy)—20 individuals in the entire area; 2) Area of Ankarakataova (forests of Ankarakataova Be and Ankarakataova kely)—none found; and 3) Area of Sahafary (degraded forest patches in Western Sahafary, Sahafary East, Sahafary North, Andravina, Sahandrano, Andranomadiro, and Analalava)—about 100 individuals (Ravaorimanana et al., 2009). None of these areas are protected. The combination of a very small range containing little and rapidly decreasing suitable habitat with high pressure from hunting makes this species especially threatened. A consortium of the Association Européenne pour l’Etude et la Conservation des Lémuriens (AEECL), the University Louis Pasteur of Strasbourg and the Fondation Nature et Decouverte supported the field work and the genetic study. Socio-economic studies are under way to determine the anthropogenic effect on the remaining population (Lernould, 2006). The Andrahona Forest is considered a sacred forest, but it is tiny. Furthermore, during a recent visit (R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs., August, 2005), it was found to be riddled with trails and in the process of being exploited for saplings for local construction. During a later visit, E. E. Louis Jr. and colleagues located eight animals, but again in very degraded habitat measuring only 400 m × 20 m in size. This is clearly a species on the verge of extinction, and in need of special attention. This could include a last-ditch effort to save a piece of remaining habitat, with the Andrahona Forest perhaps presenting the best opportunity. Another option may be to undertake a captive breeding program, although members of the genus Lepilemur have always proven difficult to keep in zoos. As indicated above, it is possible that the sportive lemur in Montagne des Français, a calcareous massif 12 km from Antsiranana (= Diego-Suarez), is L. septentrionalis (D’Cruze et al., 2007; Sabel et al., 2009). A survey and genetic study is urgently needed to determine if the species occurring there is in fact L. septentrionalis, and not the more wide-ranging L. ankaranensis. If it is, then the prospects for survival of L. septentrionalis in the wild would be considerably improved. As of 2010, this species was not being kept in captivity (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"This lemur is very difficult to find in the wild. One individual was seen recently in a small forest patch (locally referred to as the Tsaratanana Forest) in the middle of Eucalyptus plantations 5.4 km to the northwest of the village of Ankarongana, which is along the road to Irodo on the coast (R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.). It may also occur in the very small area of forest at the edge and on top of the Andrahona outcrop, and perhaps in other tiny forest patches north of Madairobe. E. E. Louis Jr. and his team found it in the Analalava Forest, approximately 30 minutes by car south of the village of Sadjoavata. However, this animal is so difficult to see that it is not recommended for first-time visitors to Madagascar. In any case, the use of experienced guides and local villagers is essential.

The ears are relatively short and rounded, the muzzle blunt, and the face dark gray to brown. The dorsal coat, including the tail, is medium brown to gray-brown and bisected by a darker brown median stripe. The ventral coat is a lighter gray-brown, paler towards the throat. This species might be confused with Cheirogaleus medius and Avahi unicolor. It can be distinguished from Cheirogaleus by its larger size, vertically-oriented posture, and clinging-leaping form of locomotion. It can usually be distinguished from Avahi by its more prominent ears. Avahi also has larger, owl-like eyes, a woollier appearance, and distinctive white patches on its thighs, and often huddles closely with other family members. The precise taxonomy of the sportive lemurs of northwestern Madagascar, and their relationship to each other, remain undetermined. Zinner et al. (2007) showed that the three teams which described new Lepilemur species there in 2006 and 2007 (Andriaholinirina et al., 2006a; Louis et al., 2006b; Craul et al., 2007) each had different concepts of L. dorsalis, and that the validity of Lepilemur tymerlachsonorum vs. Lepilemur mittermeieri in particular depends on which concept turns out to be correct. The type locality of L. dorsalis ie either Mourountsang (= Anorantsangana, 13o55’S, 47o55’E) or Passandava (= Ampasindava, about 13o40’S, 48o15’E). If the former, then L. tymerlachsonorum is a synonym of L. dorsalis and L. mittermeieri is valid. The species found at Anorontsangana is also found on Nosy Be (Zinner et al., 2007). The name Lepilemur grandidieri (Forsyth Major, 1894) was given to a species from this general area, and this too may prove to be a senior synonym of one of the species described in 2006/2007 (C. P.

It was also placed on the list of the world’s 25 Most Endangered Primates 2006–2008 (Olivieiri et al., 2007b). It occurs in the southern part of the newly-created Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, where it seems to be abundant in primary and older secondary forest. However, it probably has a very limited distribution, and the forest that it lives in is rapidly decreasing and extremely fragmented. Hunting pressure is high. Indeed, the threats that it faces are similar to those of the sympatric blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons), which is Critically Endangered (CR). A maximum of five L. sahamalazensis were found to inhabit one hectare of forest, with an average of 2.8 per hectare. Total population size was estimated to be no more than 3,000 individuals within the boundaries of the national park (Ruperti, 2007). Population densities tend to be higher in areas with more large trees, a more closed canopy, and a greater abundance of food plants, suitable sleeping holes and vegetation tangles. The presence of livestock reduces population numbers. As of 2010, this species was not being kept in captivity (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.).\n",

The Sahamalaza Peninsula can also be reached by pirogue from Maromandia.

Home ranges appear to be about one hectare in size, and are vigorously defended with loud vocalizations and displays of branch-shaking (Albignac, 1981a). Several individuals can be found sleeping in the same shelter during the day, but they tend to be solitary foragers during the night. As with other Lepilemur species leaves are a dietary mainstay, but fruit, flowers, and fleshy seeds are also eaten (Albignac, 1981b; Razanahoera-Rakotomalala, 1981; Ganzhorn, 1988; Warren and Crompton, 1997a, 1997b; Rasoloharijaona et al., 2000; Thalmann, 2001). Ganzhorn (1993) found that this sportive lemur ate lower quality leaves than at other field sites, a difference in diet that he attributed to food competition with Avahi. This lemur is most active in the first few hours after dusk, after which bouts of foraging are interspersed with periods of rest. Its most serious predator is the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox).\n",

This new assessment is supported by strong genetic evidence (Pastorini et al., 2003; Louis et al., 2006b; Craul et al., 2007).

            "_natural_history":"Lepilemur ruficaudatus is still common in much of its range. Petter et al. (1971) estimated population densities of 180–350 individuals/km2 in the Marosalaza forests. Hladik et al. (1980) described this sportive lemur as a leaf-eater, although it also eats fruits in season, especially Diospyros. Home range sizes are at or below one hectare and do not differ between males and females (Zinner et al., 2003). Adults are organized into pairs, but they rarely interact and spend very little time in close proximity to each other (Hilgartner et al., 2008). They spend the day in tree holes and can often be seen sunbathing at the entrance. According to Ganzhorn (1993), L. ruficaudatus feeds on leaves of high nutritional value in the Kirindy Forest, where Avahi occidentalis is not sympatric with it. However, in areas where Avahi and Lepilemur coexist, Avahi typically eats the higher quality leaves. Red-tailed sportive lemurs are preyed upon by the fossa and the Madagascar Harrier-hawk (Rasoloarison et al., 1995; Schülke and Ostner, 2001). They can correctly categorize vocalizations of these two predators and exhibit corresponding adaptive–evasive behavior, but they do not have specific anti-predator alarm calls (Fichtel, 2007). This species has one of the lowest resting metabolic rates recorded for any mammalian species (Schmid and Ganzhorn, 1996). Mating occurs from May to July, and a single infant is born in November (Hilgartner et al., 2008). The infant is initially transported in the mother’s mouth and “parked” on a branch or in a tree hole while she forages (Petter-Rousseaux, 1964). Infants are weaned at about 50 days, and fathers provide no infant care (Hilgartner et al., 2008).\n",

The two sexes may sleep separately or together during the day, either in tree holes or liana tangles. In spiny bush forests, leaves of the spiny Alluaudia procera and Alluaudia ascendens trees are mainstays of the diet, with flowers providing supplementary food during the dry season.

            "_identification":"Hapalemur griseus ranomafanensis is approximately the same size as H. g. griseus, with a head-body length of around 30 cm, a tail length 37 cm, a total length 67 cm, and a weight of 700–850 g (Glander et al., 1992; Terranova and Coffman, 1997; Rabarivola et al., 2007; C. P. Groves, pers. comm.). The upperparts are gray to olive-gray, while the face and underparts are lighter. The tail is gray. The fur around the eyes is a paler gray, and the ears are small and rounded (Rabarivola et al., 2007). Males and females are similar in size. Bamboo lemurs are easy to identify. They are smaller and have shorter muzzles than do members of the genus Eulemur (the only other sympatric diurnal lemurs with which they might be confused). They are also usually associated with stands of bamboo. In Ranomafana National Park this subspecies is sympatric with H. aureus and Prolemur simus (Wright, 1992; Sterling and Ramoroson, 1996; Goodman et al., 2001). With a clear sighting, H. griseus ranomafanensis can be distinguished from H. aureus by its smaller size and lack of a golden-colored face, and from Prolemur simus by its much smaller size and the lack of prominent ear tufts.\n",
            "_natural_history":"This is the best-studied of the three Hapalemur griseus subspecies. Home range size has been estimated to be as much as 15 to 20 ha at Ranomafana (Wright, 1989; Overdorff et al., 1999; Tan, 1999). Group size varies from two to seven, and groups can contain more than one breeding female (Pollock, 1986b; Tan, 1999). Territories are defended by scent-marking, vocal displays, and chasing. Both males and females are reported to disperse from their natal groups. Bamboo constitutes at least three-quarters of the diet, primarily new shoots and leaf bases to which these lemurs gain access by pulling new leaves from the end of a branch, biting the soft base, and discarding the tough leaf blade. Other food items include fig leaves, grass stems, young leaves, small fruits, flowers, and fungi (Wright, 1986; Overdorff et al., 1997; Tan, 1999). The birth season is essentially October–January, following a gestation of 137–140 days (Petter and Peyriéras, 1970a; Pollock, 1986b; Wright, 1990; Tan, 2000). Single infants are the rule, and the inter-birth interval is typically one year. Infants are first carried in the mother’s mouth, then on her back a few weeks after birth, and eventually she is able to “park” them for short periods while she forages (Tan, 2000).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"This subspecies evidently occurs in two, widely separated population pockets in east-central and west-central Madagascar, respectively. In the east, it is known from the eastern forests to the south of the Mangoro and Onive rivers (except Beanamalao, which is the type locality of H. g. gilberti) in the forests of Ranomafana and Kianjavato. In the west, it has been reported from the western forests of Tsingy de Bemaraha, probably as far as the Betsiboka River (Rabarivola et al., 2007). Further field studies are required to determine the exact extent of the distribution of H. g. ranomafanensis, in particular the boundaries between it and neighboring forms of Hapalemur.\n",

Its coat color, however, is apparently darker and redder, the ears are longer, and the tail is shorter (Groves, 2001). Mutschler (2000) also found that the vocalizations of Hapalemur meridionalis distinguish it from Hapalemur populations to the north. In Andringitra National Park, this species is sympatric with Hapalemur aureus and Prolemur simus (Wright, 1992; Sterling and Ramoroson, 1996; Goodman et al., 2001).

(2007) recorded it also at Andohahela National Park. A cytogenetic study indicated that an animal from the Atsimo region was a hybrid between this species and H. griseus ranomafanensis. At present, H. meridionalis would appear to be found from Mandena and the Andohahela region extending north.

It evidently has a preference for forests that contain bamboo or bamboo vines (Petter and Peyriéras, 1970a; Tattersall, 1982). It has also been reported from degraded habitats in the Sambirano River valley, as well as in patches of bamboo surrounded by agricultural land (Mutschler, 2000). A survey conducted in the Manongarivo Special Reserve found this species to be diurnal and its group size to be small, usually no more than four individuals (Raxworthy and Rakotondraparany, 1988). However, in the Sambirano region, Mutschler (2000) described it as being active mainly at night, and also reported observing a group of six individuals. The birth season is roughly October–January, following a gestation of 137–140 days (Petter and Peyriéras, 1970a; Pollock, 1986b; Tan, 2000).

Recent studies in the Makira Forest documented the hunting of this species, but did not determine whether current levels were sustainable (Golden, 2005). Its presence is reported in eight national parks (Ankarana, Baie de Baly, Mananara-Nord, Marojejy, Masoala, Sahamalaza-Iles Radama, Tsingy de Namoroka, and Zahamena), two strict nature reserves (Tsaratanana and Zahamena), and eight special reserves (Ambatovaky, Analamerana, Anjanaharibe-Sud, Bemarivo, Kasijy, Maningoza, Manongarivo, and Marotandrano) (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Schmid and Smolker, 1998; Hawkins et al., 1998; Thalmann et al., 1999; Randrianarisoa et al., 2001a, 2001b; C.

Head-body length and tail length are about equal at 40 cm, and the average total length is 80 cm. Adult body weight ranges from 1.1–1.55 kg, with males usually slightly larger than females (Mutschler, 1999; Ralainasolo, 2004; Rabarivola et al., 2007). The pelage is dense and woolly. It is gray-brown on the dorsal coat, and the face and ventral coat are a lighter gray. The crown and nape are chestnut-brown. The species is not likely to be confused with other lemurs in the field since it is the only diurnal lemur in its unusual reed bed habitat. The only other species reported to be sympatric with it is a mouse lemur, which is much smaller and entirely nocturnal (J. Ratsimbazafy, pers. obs.).\n",
            "_natural_history":"In its unique marshland habitat, this lemur feeds principally on four food items: the pithy stems of papyrus (Cyperus madagascariensis), tender shoots of reeds (Phragmites communis), and two species of grass (Echinocochla crusgalli and Leersia hexandra) (Mutschler, 1999). Active mainly during daylight hours, H. alaotrensis also exhibits significant nocturnal activity, a pattern referred to as cathemeral (Mutschler et al., 1998). The typical mode of locomotion is vertical clinging and leaping, and there are reports of it swimming (Petter and Peyriéras, 1975). The Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur lives in family groups of up to a dozen members, and defends territories ranging in size from 1 to 8 ha (Nievergelt et al., 1998; Razafindramahatra, 2004; J. Durbin, pers. comm.). Young are born from September through February and twins are common (Mutschler et al., 2000). Groups may contain more than one breeding female.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The Alaotran bamboo lemur is known only from the papyrus and reed beds surrounding Lac Alaotra, Madagascar’s largest lake, on the western edge of the eastern rain forest region (Mutschler and Feistner, 1995). There are two subpopulations, a small one in the northern part of the lake around the Belempona Peninsula and a larger one in the adjoining marshlands along the lake’s southwestern shores (Mutschler et al., 2001). Its entire range is evidently less than 9,000 ha, and it occurs only up to elevations of 750 m.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified H. alaotrensis as Critically Endangered (CR). Conversion of marsh habitat to rice fields has been the most significant historical threat, to the point where little suitable land remains on which local farmers might cultivate this crop. Hunting for food and capture for pets have also reduced lemur numbers (Petter and Peyriéras, 1970a; Jolly et al., 1984). Various methods of hunting and trapping are employed by local people. Direct pursuit by dogs is the most common, but they may also be captured by using a harpoon, a snare, a stick to knock them out or into the water, by burning their reed bed habitat, or just by chasing them down. Commercial drainage projects are a potential threat. Regular burning to increase cattle pasture, facilitate local fishing, and develop new rice fields in dry years reduces suitable lemur habitat and also promotes the invasion of exotic plant species that may choke the remaining marshes. Population estimates for H. alaotrensis range from 2,500 to 5,000 individuals, representing a decline of approximately 30% in just over a decade (Ralainasolo, 2004; J. Ratsimbazafy, unpubl.). Thanks to efforts of Durrell, a new 42,478-ha protected area was created there in early 2007. This includes both a strict conservation area of 8,000 ha, and an adjacent 5,200-ha core zone of marsh where controlled activities (e.g., fishing) are permitted. In addition, public awareness campaigns continue to focus on the benefits of habitat conservation to the half million or more people who live by the lake. The benefits include erosion control, the biological filtering of agricultural pollutants, and flood prevention. Lac Alaotra is a 722,500-ha Ramsar wetland site, designated in 2003. As of 2010 there was a small, self-sustaining population of around 66 individuals in various European zoos (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.). The captive population was first started by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now Durrell) back in 1990, when the first wild animals were obtained, and is an excellent example of the role that captive breeding of an endangered species can play for conservation purposes.\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The best way to see this cryptic and elusive lemur is to travel by pirogue through the reed beds of Lac Alaotra. When water levels are low, it can also be seen by walking in and around the reed beds, but it is helpful to have experienced guides familiar with the animal. The best starting points are Andreba on the eastern side of the lake or Andilana Atsimo on the western side. Both villages can be reached from Ambatondrazaka, the main town on the lake’s south side. Ambatondrazaka offers simple hotel accommodation and can be reached in 40 minutes by plane or six to seven hours by car from Antananarivo.\n",

With an adult weight of approximately 1.3–1.7 kg, it is the largest member of the genus Hapalemur, since the greater bamboo lemur (formerly H. simus) has now been placed in its own genus, Prolemur (see Groves, 2001). Head-body length is about 34 cm and tail length about 41 cm, for an overall length of 70–80 cm. The dorsal coat is reddish-brown; darker on the shoulders, back, top of the head and tail. The tail also darkens toward the tip. The ventral coat, including the inner limbs, is a paler golden-brown. A pink nose contrasts with the dark muzzle, which is surrounded by a ring of gold-colored hair on the cheeks and around the eyes. The ears are tipped with golden-brown hairs, but are not tufted. Hapalemur aureus is sympatric with H. griseus ranomafanensis in Ranomafana National Park, with H. meridionalis in Andringitra National Park, and with Prolemur simus in both of these protected areas. However, it can be readily distinguished from all of these taxa by its golden coloration, especially on the face. It is larger than the other two Hapalemur and smaller than Prolemur, and the lack of ear tufts also differentiates it from the latter. Molecular data support its inclusion in the genus Hapalemur (Pastorini et al., 2002a, 2002b).\n",
            "_natural_history":"The golden bamboo lemur is active during the day but has a distinct midday rest period. It lives in small groups of 3–4 individuals that maintain home ranges of up to 30 ha (Tan, 1999). At times, it can be quite vocal. Females give birth to a single young in November or December after a gestation of about 138 days. The young are born in an altricial state, and are kept safe in dense vegetation for the first two weeks of life (Mutschler and Tan, 2003). Based on studies at Ranomafana National Park, as much as 90% of this lemur’s diet consists of bamboo, principally giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), and the number of plant species it eats is quite low (Meier and Rumpler, 1987; Meier et al., 1987; Mutschler and Tan, 2003). Young leaves and shoots are the plant parts most readily eaten. Glander et al. (1989) found astonishingly high levels of cyanide in the shoots of giant bamboo as well as in the blood and feces of the golden bamboo lemur, and suggest that similar levels in the diets of other mammals would be lethal. Presumably, this tolerance to dietary toxins allows H. aureus to live in sympatry with three other bamboo-eating lemurs, H. meridionalis, H. g. ranomafanensis and Prolemur simus, all of which appear to avoid either plant species or plant parts with such high cyanide levels (Wright, 1989).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Hapalemur aureus is known from tropical moist lowland and montane forests of southeastern Madagascar, at altitudes of 600–1,400 m (Arrigo-Nelson and Wright, 2004). It occurs in and around Ranomafana National Park, where it has been observed as far to the north as Miaranony, and also occurs at least as far south as Andringitra National Park and in the forest corridor that connects Ranomafana with Andringitra (Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Lehman and Wright, 2000; Goodman et al., 2001; Arrigo-Nelson and Wright, 2004; Rakotondravony and Razafindramahatra, 2004; Irwin et al., 2005). However, there has recently been an unconfirmed sighting of this species as far south as the Vevembe Forest (west of Vondrozo) (P. Rabeson, pers. comm.).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The IUCN Red List assessment of 2008 classified H. aureus as Endangered (EN). The principal threat to its survival is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and the harvesting of bamboo for local use (e.g., building houses, carrying water, making baskets). Hunting for food can also be a threat in some areas. Known to occur in only two national parks (Andringitra and Ranomafana) and probably numbering less than 2,500 individuals, its distribution is patchy and it typically occurs at low population densities (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996). The Ranomafana / Andringitra forest corridor has been proposed as a conservation unit in conjunction with efforts to propagate and re-establish stands of bamboo species that serve as food for this species. As of 2010, this species was not being kept in captivity (ISIS, 2009; E. E. Louis Jr., pers. comm.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The golden bamboo lemur can be seen in Ranomafana National Park around the research station at Talatakely, but a visit of at least two or three days is recommended. The use of local guides to find this animal is essential. This genus contains a single species, Prolemur simus. Tattersall (1982) and other earlier authors had placed this animal in the genus Hapalemur as Hapalemur simus, but a recent taxonomic revision of the primates by Groves (2001) placed it in its own genus and resurrected the name Prolemur (Gray, 1871). It is still referred to as a bamboo lemur along with all members of the genus Hapalemur, and like other bamboo-eating lemurs has a broadened and shortened muzzle. However, it is much larger than any of the other species (Albrecht et al., 1990), and has at least nine cranio-dental features that are distinctive (Vuillaume-Randriamanantena et al., 1985). Genetic studies further support its separation from the other bamboo lemurs and suggest that the genus Hapalemur may, in fact, be more closely related to Lemur (Rumpler et al., 1989; Macedonia and Stanger, 1994; Stanger- Hall, 1997).\n",

            "_identification":"Prolemur simus is the largest of the bamboo lemurs and is so distinct that it has been placed in its own genus. It has a head-body length of 40–42 cm, a tail length of 45–48 cm, a total length of 85–90 cm, and a weight of 2.2–2.5 kg (Meier et al., 1987; Kappeler, 1991). The dorsal coat, including the tail, is grayish-brown with a slight reddish tinge; the head, neck, shoulders and upper arms tend to be more olive-brown. There is a rusty-brown pygal patch. The ventral coat is a lighter creamy-brown. The muzzle is blunt and dark gray, and the most distinctive feature of this species is its white ear tufts. There is no sexual difference in body weight (Tan, 2000). Garbutt (2007) mentions a population of P. simus discovered on the Andringitra Massif which might be a distinct color morph, having uniformly a deep golden-red head, upperparts, throat and underparts, but with a gray-tipped tail. The face and muzzle are dark. Individuals in this area are also said to be different in having large and prominent ears that lack the white tufts so visible in animals from the main population. The identity of this population requires further investigation. The greater bamboo lemur is sympatric with Hapalemur griseus ranomafanensis in Ranomafana National Park, with Hapalemur meridionalis in Andringitra National Park, and with Hapalemur aureus in both of these protected areas. It might be confused with any of these bamboo lemurs or with Eulemur rufifrons if one does not get a clear look at the animal. It is much larger than the Hapalemur species and distinguishable from them by its prominent white ear tufts and blunter, broader face. It also lacks the golden face of H. aureus. The facial features and ear tufts of the greater bamboo lemur also distinguish it from the sympatric E. rufifrons, which is similar in size or slightly larger.\n",
            "_natural_history":"As its common name implies, the greater bamboo lemur subsists predominantly on bamboo, but its diet includes at least seven plant species from three different families. The bamboo Cathariostachys madagascariensis can account for as much as 95% of the diet, including its shoots, young and mature leaves, and pith, so the presence of this plant is a strong determinant of the presence of Prolemur (Grassi, 1998, 2001; Tan, 1999, 2000). Other food items include flowers of the traveler’s palm (Ravenala madagascariensis), fruits of Artocarpus integrifolius, Ficus spp. and Dypsis spp., and leaves of Pennisteum clandestinum (see Meier and Rumpler, 1987). When eating bamboo, this lemur strips the outside of the live stalk and tears apart the bamboo pole to get to the pith, an impressive accomplishment for such a small animal. Feeding in this manner leaves strong evidence of its presence. There are occasional reports from agricultural plantations where bamboo is prominent. Observations of wild populations and animals in captivity suggest that P. simus is cathemeral, active during the day and at night throughout the year (Santini-Palka, 1994; Tan, 1999, 2000). It lives in polygamous groups of up to 28 animals that can occupy home ranges of 60 ha (Ranomafana; Tan, 1999, 2000) to several hundred ha (Torotorofotsy; R. Dolch, unpubl.). Ranges may overlap those of other sympatric bamboo lemur species (Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Tan, 1999, 2000). Mating begins in May or June, with infants typically born in October and November after a gestation period of approximately 150 days (Mutschler and Tan, 2003). Females usually give birth to a single young each year. Unlike the sympatric bamboo lemurs, H. meridionalis, H. g. ranomafanensis and H. aureus, P. simus females do not “park” their infants while foraging.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Historical records and subfossil remains confirm a previous widespread distribution that covered the northern, northwestern, central and eastern portions of Madagascar, including Ampasambazimba in the Itasy Basin, the Grotte d’Andrafiabè on the Ankarana Massif, the Grottes d’Anjohibè near Mahajanga, and the Tsingy de Bemaraha (Schwarz, 1931; Godfrey and Vuillaume- Randriamamantena, 1986; Wilson et al., 1988; Godfrey et al., 1999, 2004b). Until recently, documented populations were restricted to the south-central portion of the country’s eastern rain forests at elevations of 200–1,100 m (Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Arrigo-Nelson and Wright, 2004), including Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks, the corridor and isolated forests between and to the east of these localities (e.g., Ambolomavo, Ifanadiana, Kianjavato), and one locality (Evendra) southeast of Andringitra but north of the Manampatrana River (Meier and Rumpler, 1987; Wright et al., 1987; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Goodman et al., 2001; Andriaholinirina et al., 2003; Arrigo-Nelson and Wright, 2004; Irwin et al., 2005). While reports of large bamboo lemurs fitting this animal’s description have been filtering in from various sites (Rakotosamimanana et al., 2004; Schmid and Alonso, 2005), recent surveys have now confirmed its presence in the forests of Torotorofotsy, in the region of Andasibe-Mantadia (Dolch et al., 2004, 2008). Most commonly known as Varibolomavo in the Ranomafana region, and as Godrogodroka in the Torotorofotsy region, vernacular names for the species vary widely across its range. Under the vernacular names given above, we include Malagasy names for several localities from which its presence has not yet been confirmed, but where names for it apparently exist.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified P. simus as Critically Endangered (CR). It has been on the list of the World’s 25 Most Endangered Primates, prepared every two years by the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group, the International Primatological Society, and Conservation International, since 2002. Prolemur is threatened by slash-and-burn agriculture, mining, illegal logging, and the cutting of bamboo. It is also hunted for food, using slingshots, spears and snares (Meier, 1987; Meier and Rumpler, 1987; Wright et al., 2008; E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.). Remnant populations now receive protection in the Andringitra and Ranomafana National Parks. A recent assessment of the species (Wright et al., 2008, 2009) has shown that the species only occurs at 12 sites and now occupies only 1–4% of its former range. However, it is quite possible that future field surveys will turn up additional populations, as in the case of the Torotorofotsy population. As of 2009, there were 15 individuals in six European collections, along with four in Parc Ivoloina, Madagascar (ISIS, 2009; E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The best location for seeing this species is Ranomafana National Park, which also has populations of two other bamboo lemurs, H. g. ranomafanensis and H. aureus. Finding all three is possible but requires time and perseverance, as all are secretive. Use of a local guide is essential and greatly increases the likelihood of finding these animals, two of which are among the world’s rarest and most endangered primates. The Agricultural Station of Kianjavato near Ranomafana is also an excellent site for this species. It is possible to see the Torotorofotsy population near Andasibe by taking a guide from the Association Mitsinjo. The Torotorofotsy animals are being studied by this local conservation organization, and you will have the chance to join the researchers as they track the animals.\n",

            "_identification":"Lemur catta is a relatively large, diurnal lemur, easily recognized by its black-and- white ringed tail. It is by far the most terrestrial of the lemurs. It has a head-body length of 39–46 cm, a tail length of 56–63 cm, a total length of 95–110 cm, and a mean weight of 2.2 kg (Sussman, 1991). The dorsal coat is gray to rosy-brown along the back, gray along the flanks, limbs and haunches, and darker gray on the crown and neck. The ventral coat is white to cream. The throat, cheeks, ears, and forehead are white. The muzzle is grayish and the nose is black. The eyes are circled by black, triangular rings. The tail is ringed with black-and-white transverse bands along its entire length, the tip being black. Both sexes possess small dark (antebrachial) glands on the palmar surface of the wrists (the trait that associates Lemur with Hapalemur more closely than with Eulemur), these being overlain by a spur in the males, and males also have larger (brachial) cutaneous glands on the medial aspects of the upper arms near the shoulders. This species is the best known of Madagascar’s lemurs and cannot be confused with any other.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Lemur catta is the most intensively studied of all lemurs (Jolly and Pride, 1999; Sauther et al., 1999; Jolly, 2003; Jolly et al., 2006a). It inhabits many forest types throughout its range, including dry scrub and Didiereaceae forest, as well as deciduous and gallery forests. Population densities vary with habitat type, with highs of 100 individuals/km2 in the dry forests of the Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve and 250–600 individuals/km2 in the gallery forests and secondary forests of the Berenty Private Reserve (Sussman, 1991; Sauther et al., 1999; Koyama et al., 2001; Jolly et al., 2002). Ring-tailed lemurs live in multi-male multi-female groups usually numbering 6–24 animals but groups of over 30 individuals are reported occasionally (Jolly, 2003). Home range size varies from 6 to 23 ha, and groups have been recorded maintaining the same home ranges for more than three decades (Budnitz and Dainis, 1975; Sussman, 1977; Jolly and Pride, 1999; Mertl-Milhollen, 2000). Females are dominant over males and remain in their natal groups (Jolly, 1966; Sussman, 1977; Kappeler, 1990a). Males become sexually mature at about three years, and some emigrate at this time (Jones, 1983; Sussman, 1992; Koyama et al., 2002; Gould et al., 2003). Females typically have multiple mates (Pereira and Weiss, 1991). Males compete for females in “jump fights,” when they leap into the air, each opponent trying to slash the other with its upper canines and often inflicting significant wounds. Competition among females of different groups is high, the most aggressive animals typically facing off against each other and engaging in threatening behaviors, but rarely inflicting any physical damage. Within the group, however, female competition for dominance can result in serious wounds and the expulsion of inferior members (Vick and Pereira, 1989; Jolly et al., 2000), as well as the possibility of eviction and range takeover (Ichino and Koyama, 2006). Scent-marking is an important means of communication. Females demarcate the territory by marking branches with the vulva (Mertl-Milhollen, 2006; Palagi and Norscia, 2009). Males use wrist and shoulder glands to mark their tails, which they then wave at each other during ritual “stink fights.” Males also use the spurs on their forearms to make small scars in tree trunks, which they then anoint with secretions from their scent glands (Kappeler, 1998). Mating begins in mid-April and most young are born in September (Koyama, 1988; Koyama et al., 2001). Males guard their mates after copulating. Some females may be in estrus several times, as late as the middle of August (T. Soma, pers. obs.). Females first give birth at three years of age, and most produce offspring annually; single births are the norm, but twins are born on occasion. The gestation period is 138–141 days in the Berenty population (S. Ichino and T. Soma, unpubl.). The young are precocious, transferring to their mother’s back at one to two weeks old, and soon thereafter to the backs of other group members. Infant mortality is high. At Beza-Mahafaly, about half of all infants die in their first year and only about 40% reach maturity (Sussman, 1991). In the wild, the longest lifespan was recorded in Berenty, where a female reached 20 years of age (S. Ichino, unpubl.). This is the most terrestrial of the lemurs (Sussman, 1974). In Andringitra National Park, where the species occurs above the line of seasonal frost, troops regularly move along rocky, barren terrain and take shelter at night in caves (Goodman and Langrand, 1996b). The diet consists of fruit, leaves, flowers, herbs, bark, and sap from close to three dozen different plant species (Simmen et al., 2006a, 2006b). The kily tree (Tamarindus indica) is especially favored, with its fruit and leaves accounting for as much as 50% of all time spent feeding throughout the year in areas where it is present (Rasamimanana and Rafidinarivo, 1993; Sauther, 1993; Soma, 2006). Ring-tailed lemurs eat rotten wood, earth, insects, and small vertebrates, and they are also known to raid crops (Jolly, 1966; Budnitz and Dainis, 1975; Oda, 1996; Simmen et al., 2003, 2006b). In recent years, biologists and visitors to the Berenty Private Reserve have commented on the “ragged” condition of its ring-tailed lemurs. One explanation was that crowded conditions in the available habitat are having adverse effects on this population. Current studies, however, suggest that hair loss experienced by Lemur catta at Berenty is due to feeding on the leaves, fruit, and flowers of the introduced tree Leucaena leucocephala, which contains mimosine, an amino acid and known inhibitor of cell division in mammalian species (Crawford et al., 2006; Jolly, 2009a, 2009b; B. Simmen, pers. comm.). As of early 2010, Leucaena had been removed almost entirely from Berenty, and the affected groups appear to be recovering. At Berenty, some ring-tailed lemur troops also eat and very much depend upon other introduced plants such as Opuntia sp. or Azadirachla indica (Simmen et al., 2003; Pride, 2006; Soma, 2006), but the influence of these exotic foods on the health of the lemurs is not yet clear. Ring-tailed lemurs sometimes fall prey to the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), introduced civet (Viverricula indica), Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus), Madagascar ground boa (Acrantophis dumerelii), and domestic cats and dogs (Goodman, 2003). An infant was reported to have been eaten by a hybrid Eulemur female in 2000 in Berenty (S. Pinkus, pers. obs.).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The ring-tailed lemur is found in the tropical dry forests and spiny bush of southern and southwestern Madagascar, as far east as near Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin), as far north as Belo-sur-Tsiribihina along the west coast, and inland to the mountains of Andrigitra on the southeastern plateau (Goodman and Langrand, 1996b; Yoder et al., 1999). The (historical) northern limit extends all the way up to the Morondava River, and the species exists today in Kirindy Mitea at low densities. It is very patchily distributed throughout this large area, and population densities are highly variable (Sussman et al., 2003).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified L. catta as Near Threatened (NT). Habitat loss and hunting are the most significant threats. It has a strong preference for gallery forests, which are very limited in extent in southern Madagascar, and spiny forest, which continues to be destroyed to create pasture, for charcoal production, and for agriculture, especially corn plantations (Sussman et al., 2003). The ring-tailed lemur is also hunted for food in certain areas, and frequently kept as a pet (O’Connor, 1987; Goodman and Raselimanana, 2003; Goodman et al., 2004). Fortunately, L. catta is found in a number of protected areas, including five national parks (Andohahela, Andringitra, Isalo, Tsimanampetsotsa, and Zombitse-Vohibasia), three special reserves (Beza-Mahafaly, Kalambatritra, and Pic d’Ivohibe), the Ambosary Sud and Berenty Private Reserves, the Anja Community Reserve, and in the Kirindy- Mitea National Park, just south of Morondava (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Goodman, 1999; Hawkins, 1999; Zinner et al., 2001; Goodman and Raselimanana, 2003; P. Kappeler, pers. obs.). It does not occur in the Kirindy Forest Reserve, north of Morondava where the German Primate Center has its field research base. It has also been reported from the unprotected forests of Ankoba, Ankodida, Anjatsikolo, Anbatotsilongolongo, Bereny, Mahazoarivo, Masiabiby, and Mikea (Fenn et al., 1999; Seddon et al., 2000). It is important to note that many of the best remaining forest patches within the range of L. catta, and where it appears to occur at the highest densities, are found on sacred lands (Sussman et al., 2003). As of 2009, there were an estimated 2500, ring-tailed lemurs in zoos around the world, in addition to many more in smaller roadside collections, laboratories, and the pet trade. The species is not only the most common lemur in captivity, but indeed the most common of all captive primates (ISIS, 2009; I. J. Porton, pers. comm.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"This species can be seen in all the protected areas within its range, but is most easily observed in the Berenty Private Reserve, and in Andohahela National Park, Isalo National Park, and Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park. Berenty is 21⁄2–3 hour drive by car west of Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin), and is the first stop on most tours to Madagascar. Habituated groups of ring-tailed lemurs and Verreaux’s sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) can be seen within minutes of arriving at the reserve. In Berenty, L. catta is seen mainly in gallery forest dominated by tamarind trees, but it can also be seen in patches of spiny forest on the grounds of the reserve. An interesting site to view L. catta in Andohahela National Park is near the small village of Hazafotsy at the edge of the spiny forest portion of this protected area, about three to four hours by four-wheel drive vehicle from either Berenty or Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin). This trip is a rewarding experience that takes the visitor through an attractive piece of southern spiny forest that is lightly inhabited by scattered villages of the Tandroy, the traditional people of this region. The sandstone cliffs and canyons of Isalo National Park are also a good site for ring- tailed lemurs, which are easily observed in the Canyon des Makis. In Andringitra National Park, ring-tails can be observed at Camp Catta and at a community conservation site called Anja on the main road from Ambalavao heading towards Toliara.\n",

Schwitzer, pers. obs.). Males and females are similarly colored. The dorsal coat is brown to gray-brown and the ventral coat is paler, tending toward gray. The face, muzzle and crown are dark brown to almost black, the beard is lighter, and patches of light fur above the eyes are variable. Animals in the northern part of this lemur’s range have large light patches over the eyes, while the eye patches of animals from more southerly populations may be barely discernible. The eyes are orange-red. In the field, E. fulvus is most likely to be confused with the mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz) in the west and the red-bellied lemur (E. rubriventer) in the east, especially if only a fleeting glimpse of the animal is obtained. Eulemur mongoz tends to be grayer and exhibits sexually dimorphic coloration, as does E. rubriventer. Male red-bellied lemurs also have distinctive white “tear-drops” beneath their eyes, and females have white fur on the throat, chest and abdomen. Eulemur fulvus is usually more active and visible and moves in larger groups than these two species, which also facilitates distinguishing it from its congeners. The population of this species on Mayotte shows many signs of being a hybrid swarm, composed mainly of E. fulvus founders but with features of a number of other brown lemur species (Mittermeier et al., 2008c). Further genetic investigation on this population would be interesting, but we do not consider it to be taxonomically distinct.\n",
            "_natural_history":"The brown lemur has been studied at Ankarafantsika by Harrington (1975), on the island of Mayotte by Tattersall (1977a), and at Andasibe (= Périnet) by Ganzhorn (1988). In Madagascar, groups vary in size from 3 to 12, home ranges from 7 to 20 ha, and population densities are 40 to 60 individuals/km2. Female dominance appears not to be a feature of this species (Pereira et al., 1990). The diet consists largely of fruits, young leaves, and flowers. Rasmussen (1999) found that E. fulvus sampled more than 100 plant species, but that only 15 of these made up the bulk of the diet. On Mayotte, Tattersall (1982) described considerable seasonal variation in diet, with fruit, leaves or flowers predominating in any one month. Ganzhorn (1988) also documented high levels of tannins and alkaloids in the diet. In terms of activity pattern, Rasmussen (1999) noted that the brown lemur remains diurnal throughout the year, but increases levels of nocturnal activity during the dry season.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"This species is found in western Madagascar north of the Betsiboka River, on the high plateau in scattered forest fragments, and in eastern Madagascar to the north of the Mangoro River as far as Tsaratanana, inland of the range of Eulemur albifrons. It is one of only two species to occur outside of Madagascar, being found on the island of Mayotte in the Comoros, where it was apparently introduced by our own species prior to European arrival. However, as noted above, the Mayotte population is not pure Eulemur fulvus. The western populations can be divided into two sub-distributions, a southern one extending from the Betsiboka River and Ankarafantsika National Park north to the Maevarano River, and a northern one ranging from the Manongarivo Special Reserve to the Mahavavy du Nord River. Animals in the northern reaches of this range may also be found throughout the moister forests of the Sambirano region, as well as on the slopes of the Tsaratanana Massif, and they are very similar in coloration to the brown lemurs found on the island of Mayotte. In eastern Madagascar, E. fulvus is found northeast of Antananarivo and as far as the Ambatovaky Special Reserve. The distribution of E. fulvus in the northern part of its range and its relation to E. albifrons remain unclear, and additional surveys are needed.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment of E. fulvus classified it as Vulnerable (VU). The principal threats are habitat loss due to slash- and-burn agriculture and hunting with firearms, blowguns, and traps.

            "_natural_history":"Many studies of “Eulemur rufus” carried out in the past (e.g., Sussman, 1974, 1975, 1977) are now attributed to E. rufifrons (C. P. Groves, pers. comm.). Eulemur rufus itself has not yet been the subject of a detailed behavioral or ecological study.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The rufous brown lemur is found in tropical dry lowland forests in west-central coastal Madagascar. It is patchily distributed from the Mahavavy du Sud River south at least to the Tsiribih.ina River. It may occur south of the Tsiribihina, but this is questionable. The northernmost recorded locality is Betsako, 15°35’S, 46°23’E; the southernmost, Beroboka, 19°58’S, 44°37’E (C. P. Groves, pers. comm.; C. Roos, pers. obs.).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"Very little is known of the conservation status of E. rufus, so the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified it as Data Deficient (DD). It is found in three national parks (Baie de Baly, Tsingy de Bemaraha, and Tsingy de Namoroka), the Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve, three special reserves (Bemarivo, Kasijy, and Maningoza), and in the Tsiombokibo Classified Forest (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Hawkins et al., 1998; Hawkins, 1999; Thalmann et al., 1999; Randrianarisoa et al., 2001; Goodman and Raselimanana, 2003). The numbers of this species in captivity are difficult to determine at this time, owing to taxonomic confusion with E. rufifrons. It is likely that most captive animals are E. rufifrons, but this remains to be verified.\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The best place to see E. rufus is in the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park, though it is also readily observed in Baie de Baly National Park. The Tsiombikibo Classified Forest near Mitsinjo is another possibility, although access can be difficult.\n",

            "_identification":"Eulemur rufifrons is a relatively large brown lemur with a head-body length of 40–48 cm, a tail length of 45–55 cm, an overall length of 85–103 cm, and a mean body weight of 2.2–2.3 kg (Glander et al., 1992). This species is sexually dichromatic. In males the coloration is iron-gray above with a grayish-fawn underside; the crown is dark red and the tail black along part of its length. The digits are red. In females, the coloration is brownish olive-gray above with a whitish-red underside, a reddish head, and an orange-tipped tail. There is little gray above the eyes (Groves, 2001, 2006). All young are born with adult male coloration, the female infants undergoing a change into adult female coloration at 7–17 weeks (Barthold et al., 2009). This species may be confused with Eulemur rubriventer where the two are sympatric in the eastern rain forest. However, E. rubriventer can usually be distinguished by its redder coloration, the lack of white eyebrow patches, and by the prominent white tear-drop patches seen in males. A large hybridization zone with E. cinereiceps appears to be centered on the Iantara River (the headwaters of the Manampatra), near Andringitra National Park (Wyner et al., 2002; Sterling and Ramarason, 1996; Delmore et. al., 2009), and there is also an introduced population of this species (hybridized with E. collaris) inhabiting the Berenty Private Reserve in southern Madagascar. Finally, it can easily be confused with captive E. rufus, a species with which it was considered conspecific until quite recently.\n",
            "_natural_history":"This species has been studied in western Madagascar in the deciduous forests of Antserananomby and Tongobato (Sussman, 1974, 1975, 1977), in the Kirindy Forest (Donati et al., 1999; Ostner and Kappeler, 1999), and in eastern Madagascar in Ranomafana National Park (Meyers, 1988; Overdorff, 1991; Johnson and Overdorff, 1999). These publications pre-date the recent recognition of E. rufifrons and E. rufus as separate species, and therefore refer to this species as E. fulvus rufus. The results of these and other studies demonstrate a very adaptable behavioral ecology. In the west, population density is reported to be very high and home ranges small, while in the east, population densities tend to be lower and home ranges as large as 100 ha. Group size is more consistent geographically, varying from 4–17 (with an average of nine) in the west and from 6–18 (with an average of eight) in the east. Dominance hierarchies are unknown in any populations, and rates of aggression appear very low. The diet of some western populations is less diverse and much more folivorous than that of eastern populations, and includes a high proportion of leaves, pods, stems, flowers, bark, and sap of the kily tree (Tamarindus indica). At Kirindy, E. rufifrons includes substantial amounts of fruit in its diet, and is the sole seed disperser for a large number of tree species with large seeds (Ganzhorn et al., 1999). The diet of eastern populations is dominated by fruit (Overdorff, 1993, 1996a, 1996b). Along with E. rubriventer, E. rufifrons feeds on flowers and nectar more often during in the warmer, wetter months of the year (Overdorff, 1992). Although largely diurnal, western populations of this lemur increase their nocturnal activity during the dry season (Donati et al., 1999; Rasmussen, 1999; Kappeler and Erkert, 2003). Eastern populations are entirely cathemeral and active across a 24-hour period throughout the year (Overdorff and Rasmussen, 1995). Reproduction is seasonal. In western populations, one male typically monopolizes the females of the group, while in the east several males may participate in reproductive pairings (Overdorff, 1998; Ostner and Kappeler, 1999). In the west, mating takes place in June, births occur in September and October, and the young are weaned by January (Sussman, 1977).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The red-fronted brown lemur is found on both sides of Madagascar, in the southeast and the southwest. It inhabits both tropical dry lowland forests (in the west) and tropical moist lowland to montane forests (in the east), up to elevations of 1,700 m (Petter et al., 1977; Tattersall, 1982). In the southwest, it occurs patchily from the Tsiribihina River south to the region of the Onilahy River and the Andringitra Massif. In the east, it ranges from the Mangoro River and the Onive River in the north, with the southern limit probably being the Manampatrana River (which, for the most part, separates it from E. cinereiceps). Reports of its occurrence in the Kalambatritra Special Reserve are incorrect, since the species there is evidently E. collaris (Irwin et al., 2001).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"Eulemur rufifrons was classified as Near Threatened (NT) in the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment. The principal threat to its survival is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, burning for pasture, fuelwood gathering, and illegal logging. Hunting and trapping are also threats throughout its range—it is one of the most commonly hunted lemurs in all of Madagascar (E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.). It is found in four national parks (Andringitra, Isalo, Ranomafana, and Zombitse-Vohibasia), two special reserves (Andranomena, Pic d’Ivohibe), and in the Kirindy Forest (part of the Menabe-Antimena Protected Area) (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Sterling and Ramoroson, 1996; Hawkins et al., 1998; Hawkins, 1999; Thalmann et al., 1999; Goodman and Raselimanana, 2003; Sussman et al., 2003). The status of this species in captivity is difficult to determine at this time, owing to taxonomic confusion with E. rufus. However, both E. rufus and E. rufifrons are found in a number of collections worldwide.\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"An excellent place to see the red-fronted brown lemur in eastern Madagascar is Ranomafana National Park. April and May appear to be particularly good months for viewing, as Chinese guava (Psidium spp.) is in fruit and lemur groups tend to gather near the Belle Vue site (Garbutt, 2007), but the animal can be seen throughout the park. In the west, the Kirindy Forest north of Morondava offers the best opportunities for viewing this species. In addition, an introduced group that has hybridized with Eulemur collaris is easily seen in the Berenty Private Reserve in the far south. About eight captive animals, orphans from hunting in the Analabe Reserve in the Menabe forest, north of Morondava, escaped into Berenty during a hurricane in January 1975. The red-collared brown lemurs with which they hybridized were subsequently introduced gradually (a similar number of orphans obtained from the Forte-Dauphin market) up to 1985 (Jolly, 2004; p.30; pers. comm.).\n",

Schwitzer, pers. obs.). This species is sexually dichromatic and its defining characteristics are largely restricted to the head of the male. It is also cranially the most distinct species of the fulvus group (C. P. Groves, pers. comm.). In males, the dorsal coat and tail are medium to dark brown, darkening and becoming redder moving front to rear. The ventral fur is pale gray, sometimes creamy-white on the throat and chest. The muzzle is black and contrasts with the thick white beard, bushy cheeks, and crown. The eyes are reddish-orange. In females, the dorsal fur is similar in color to that of the male and the ventral fur is gray. The face, muzzle, chest and shoulders are dark gray, as is the fur of the head, which contrasts sharply with the white head of the male. In both sexes the tail is darker than the dorsal coat. The male is easily distinguished from other Eulemur species by its distinctive white face. Although the other northern species, E. sanfordi, also has light colored ear tufts and a beard, the beard is much fuller in E. albifrons. Hybrids have been seen from north of Sambava. Females are sometimes difficult to distinguish from related species.\n",

Population density has been estimated at around 15 individuals/km2 (Rakotondratsima and Kremen, 2001). Females are reported to feed more heavily on flowers than males during the dry season, when they also are more likely to give birth (Vasey, 1997a). Fecundity has been measured at 0.2–0.7 young per adult female per year, with most adult females producing offspring each year (Rakotondratsima and Kremen, 2001).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"This species is found in tropical moist lowland and montane rain forest (sea level to 1,600 m) in northeastern Madagascar, occurring from the Bemarivo River, near Sambava, south to the region of Mananara-Nord, including the Masoala Peninsula and the island of Nosy Mangabe, and possibly extending from Marojejy west into Tsaratanana. It formerly occurred in areas north of the present range, but apparently has been extirpated there. An isolated population is also found in the Betampona Strict Nature Reserve, which was likely introduced, and the Nosy Mangabe population may also be introduced (E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.).

The principal threats are habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining. Hunting is also a major problem in some areas, and can be quite heavy. For example, recent studies in the Makira region have found that animals are taken with firearms and traps, that this is the most heavily hunted of all the lemurs, and that current levels of hunting are not sustainable (Golden, 2005). It is found in three national parks (Mananara-Nord, Marojejy, and Masoala) and two special reserves (Anjanaharibe-Sud and Nosy Mangabe), with an additional, introduced population in the Betampona Strict Nature Reserve (Mittermeier et al., 1994; E.

Introduced animals are also easily seen on Ile Roger or Aye-aye Island, close to the town of Mananara-Nord. Other places to observe wild populations include most sites in Masoala National Park, between camps 1 and 2 in Marojejy National Park, and near Befingotra in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve (Garbutt, 2007).

This species is sexually dichromatic. In males, the dorsal coat is brown, darker along the back and on the tail. The ventral coat is pale brownish-gray. Prominent ear tufts are the most notable feature of the male of this species, ranging from off-white to cream to slightly rufous, and complemented by a beard of similar color that gives the appearance of a mane. The nose, the muzzle, and the face are black. The top of the head is cream-colored to brown and always lighter than the dorsal coat. In females, the dorsal coat and tail are gray-brown, and the ventral coat is a paler gray. The face is also gray, as are the shoulders and the upper part of the back.

In Ankarana, it appears to favor secondary forest, and is active both day and night (Wilson et al., 1988, 1989; Fowler et al., 1989; Freed, 1996). Groups are typically multi-male/multi-female. In Ankarana they may include up to 15 animals (Wilson et al., 1989), significantly larger than those observed in Montagne d’Ambre, which range from three to nine animals (Freed, 1996). At Montagne d’Ambre, overlapping home ranges of close to 15 ha have been reported (Arbelot-Tracqui, 1983). In Analamerana, a population density of 3.5–5.4 individuals/km2 has been reported by Banks (2005). Mating occurs in late May, and births usually take place in late September or early October after a gestation of about 120 days. There is no evidence of female dominance. The diet of Sanford’s brown lemur consists primarily of fruit, but includes other plant parts (buds, young leaves, flowers) according to seasonal availability, and also the occasional invertebrate (e.g., centipedes, millipedes and spiders). Flowers make up a greater portion of the diet during dry season months than they do during the rainy season (Freed, 1996). Eulemur sanfordi is also reported to associate with E. coronatus during the wet season, a time of greater food availability (Freed, 1996).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Sanford’s brown lemur has a restricted range in northern Madagascar centered on the forests of Ankarana, Analamerana, and Montagne d’Ambre, with a disjunct population found in the Daraina region to the southeast. The Manambato River is the southern limit of its range, although hybrids with E. albifrons appear to occur between Vohémar and Sambava. This lemur is absent from very dry forests such as those of Cap d’Ambre, but it does occur in parts of the Montagne des Français near Antsiranana (= Diégo- Suarez).\n",

(1990) reported the same for Analamerana. This species is also frequently kept as a pet in the Antsiranana region (O. Langrand, pers. obs.). It occurs in two national parks (Ankarana and Montagne d’Ambre) and in the Analamerana Special Reserve (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989), as well as in the forests of Daraina (the Loky-Manambato Protected Area) (Randrianarisoa et al., 1999).

This species is sexually dichromatic. In males, the dorsal coat is gray-brown, the tail and lower limbs slightly darker, and a dark brown stripe often runs along the spine. The ventral coat is a paler gray, as are the head and face. A dark gray crown turns lighter on the neck and shoulders. Both the cheeks and beard are white or light cream and bushy. Coloration of the males of this lemur is very similar to that of E. collaris, except that male E. cinereiceps have white beards rather than the rufous beards of E. collaris. Female E. cinereiceps are virtually indistinguishable from female E. collaris, the coat being reddish-brown above with lighter underparts. Their faces are uniformly slate-gray, with a short, reddish-brown beard that matches the coat color and is not bushy like that of the male (S. E. Johnson, pers. comm.). Genetic analyses show that these two taxa are distinct species (Djletati et al., 1997; Wyner et al., 1999b), as do field studies in apparent hybrid zones of E. rufifrons and E. cinereiceps (Sterling and Ramarason, 1996; Johnson and Wyner, 2000). Lemur (recte Eulemur) cinereiceps was described by Grandidier and Milne-Edwards in 1890, and is illustrated in their monumental work on Madagascar. The specimen upon which this species was based was a female, hence the Latin name (“gray head”). Unfortunately, although the Grandidier plates are excellent, text was produced only for the Indriidae, not for the remaining lemurs. Schwarz (1931) assigned the cinereiceps name to two Paris museum specimens from two localities in southeastern Madagascar, Farafangana and Solohy. This animal remained in obscurity for a long time, until it was resurrected by Groves (1974). Unaware of this, Rumpler (1975) described the white-collared brown lemur as Lemur albocollaris, and this name, later changed to Eulemur albocollaris, has been used for this species for the better part of the last 35 years (including in the last two editions of this field guide). However, a recent survey by Johnson et al. (2008) found that the animals living in Farafangana and Solohy are in fact what has usually been referred to as Eulemur albocollaris. This evidence, added to that of Schwarz (1931), seems to confirm that Grandidier and Milne-Edwards’ cinereiceps was based on females of the species named albocollaris by Rumpler (1975). Johnson et al. (2008) have reviewed the literature, and conclude that, according to Art. 23.9.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the senior synonym cannot be rejected in this instance, and that the correct name of the white-collared brown lemur is indeed Eulemur cinereiceps (C. P. Groves, pers. comm.). Consequently, we have adopted this name for the brown lemur species from this part of southeastern Madagascar, and no longer use the name E. albocollaris.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Information regarding the natural history of this lemur comes largely from recent studies conducted in the forests of Vevembe. Johnson (2002) found it to be it is mainly frugivorous, its diet supplemented with leaves, flowers, and fungi. Flowers are an especially important food item late in the dry season. Eulemur cinereiceps is cathemeral, remaining active both day and night throughout the year. Social groups also tend to be multi-male/multi-female and relatively large. They regularly exhibit fission/ fusion. Female dominance has not been observed.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The white-collared brown lemur has the most restricted range of any Eulemur species. It occurs at low densities in a thin strip of tropical moist lowland forest (sea level to 500 m) in southeastern Madagascar from just above the Manampatrana River south to the Mananara River (Petter and Petter-Rousseaux, 1979; Tattersall, 1982), with a small, isolated population at Manombo and Agnalazaha on the coast south of Farafangana (Johnson and Overdorff, 1999; R. A. Mittermeier and J. Ratsimbazafy, pers. obs.). A hybrid zone with E. rufifrons appears to occur at the Iantara River (the headwaters of the Manampatra) near Andringitra National Park. Recent analyses of satellite imagery estimate that total habitat remaining within the range of this species is little more than 700 km2 (Johnson and Wyner, 2000; Irwin et al., 2005).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"Eulemur cinereiceps was classified as Endangered (EN) in the IUCN Red List assessment of 2008. However, a review by Johnson et al. (2009) has concluded that it is Critically Endangered (CR). It has an extremely small range, and a cyclone in 1997 reduced its population by about 50% (Ratsimbazafy et al., 2002). What is more, it has apparently undergone hybridization with E. rufifrons in the northern part of its range, about 50% of its total distribution (K. Delmore, in prep.). Coastal populations have apparently undergone a significant genetic bottleneck. Effective population size (number of breeding individuals) falls well below total population estimates (R. Brenneman, E. E. Louis Jr. and S. E. Johnson, in prep.). In addition, preliminary evidence suggests heavy infestations of some parasites (e.g., pinworms) that could reduce fitness, particularly if degraded environmental conditions compromise immune response (S. Martin, in prep.). Recognizing its critical status, E. cinereiceps has been listed as one of the world’s 25 most endangered primates since 2004 (in 2004 and 2006 under the name E. albocollaris) (Johnson et al., 2009). The principal threats to its survival are habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and logging, and hunting with snares, shotguns, and slingshots. Apparently, it is easily baited and trapped during the fruiting season of the strawberry guava, Psidium cattlianum (J. Ratsimbazafy, pers. obs.). On the coast, the species numbers only in the low hundreds. It is found in the Manombo Special Reserve and also the Agnalazaha Forest, which is now being managed by the Missouri Botanical Garden. Unfortunately, this represents less than 5% of the remaining habitat within this species’ range (Irwin et al., 2005). Eulemur cinereiceps also occurs in two unprotected forests, Vevembe and Lambohazo, west of Vondrozo, both of which could be added to existing parks and reserves (Johnson and Overdorff, 1999). The population outside Andringitra National Park hybridizes with E. rufifrons (CBSG, 2002; Johnson, 2002). Expansion of the Manombo Special Reserve to include the neighboring classified forest is a high conservation priority, as is preservation of the existing, very interesting hybrid zone. A detailed search of remaining forests in the immediate Farafangana region is a high priority, since the protected areas in the broader region surrounding Farafangana all seem to harbor E. cinereiceps. Conservation International is presently initiating programs for the management of the Fandriana- Vondrozo forest corridor. This will be critical for the long-term survival of the white- collared brown lemur as the vast majority of populations are found within this corridor and few are presently protected. As of 2009, there were approximately a dozen white-collared brown lemurs reported in four zoological collections (ISIS, 2009), but only one of these (Linton Zoo, UK) is keeping a breeding group (C. Schwitzer, pers. obs.).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The easiest place to see the white-collared brown lemur is the Manombo Special Reserve and the associated classified forest, about 30 km south of Farafangana on RN12 (Garbutt, 2007; J. Ratsimbazafy and R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.). A paved road leads visitors to the edge of the reserve, where guest bungalows are now available. The species can also be seen in the Agnalahaza Forest, 40 km south of Farafangana on RN12 and at a private reserve about 7 km inland to the west on a very rough dirt road. An alternative viewing site is the strip of forest just west of the town of Vondrozo on either side of RN27. Access to this site is a bit more difficult, especially during the wet season. Trips to these sites can be arranged through an Antananarivo-based tour operator or through hotels in Farafangana.\n",

This species is sexually dichromatic. In males, the dorsal coat is brownish-gray, the tail is darker, and there is also a dark stripe along the spine. The ventral coat is a paler gray. The muzzle, face and crown are dark gray to black. The creamy to rufous-brown cheeks and beard are thick and bushy, while the creamy to gray-colored eyebrow patches vary in their prominence. In females, the dorsal coat is browner or more rufous than that of the male. The ventral coat is a pale creamy-gray. The face and head are gray. The cheeks are rufous-brown, but less prominent than in the males. Both sexes have orange-red eyes. The red-collared brown lemur is similar in coloration to Eulemur cinereiceps. Male E. collaris can be distinguished from male E. cinereiceps by their beards, those of the former being cream-colored or rufous while those of the latter are white. Female E. collaris are virtually indistinguishable from female E. cinereiceps (S. E. Johnson, pers. comm.). Recent genetic analyses support full species status for both taxa (Djletati et al., 1997; Wyner et al., 1999b).\n",
            "_natural_history":"Very little information has been published regarding the natural history of this lemur. It is an inhabitant of moist tropical forest, and appears to be common where it occurs. Irwin et al. (2005) estimated a population density of 14 individuals/km2. It is believed to be largely frugivorous and cathemeral, meaning that it is active both day and night throughout the year. Social groups tend to be multi-male/multi-female. Female dominance has not been observed (Donati, 2002; Bollen et al., 2004).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The red-collared brown lemur is found in tropical moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, from Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) north to the Mananara River. The western limits of its range are the forests of the Kalambatritra region, including the Kalambatritra Special Reserve. The Mananara River serves as a boundary between the ranges of E. collaris and E. cinereiceps, except for an isolated population at Midongy du Sud National Park (Irwin et al., 2005) and another at Vohipaho, near Vangaindrano (S. E. Johnson, pers. comm.). There is also a small population in the Sainte-Luce Private Reserve.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified E. collaris as Vulnerable (VU). The principal threats are habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production, hunting for food, and capture to supply local pet trades (Raharivololona and Ranaivosoa, 2000). It occurs in the national parks of Andohahela and Midongy du Sud, in the Kalambatritra Special Reserve, and in the Sainte-Luce Private Reserve (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Mittermeier et al., 1994; Wright and Porter, 2004; Irwin et al., 2005). It is also found in the Mandena Conservation Zone, privately maintained by QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) (a partnership between the Government of Madagascar and Rio Tinto, in the development of an ilmenite mine near Fort-Dauphin). Six to eight orphan E. collaris that had been purchased in the Forte-Dauphin market were introduced into the Berenty Private Reserve over some years up to 1985. Other red-collared brown lemurs were introduced to the Kaleta Private Reserve nearby, and they also spread into Berenty. They hybridized with E. rufifrons which had been introduced previously (Jolly, 2004; p.30; pers.comm.). As of 2009, there were 37 red-collared brown lemurs reported in zoological collections in Europe and North America (ISIS, 2009).\n",

The Mandena Conservation Zone can be visited with the help of local tourist agencies or through contact with QIT Madagascar minerals in Tolagnaro. The Sainte-Luce Private Reserve is owned by M. Jean de Heaulme, the owner of Berenty, and arrangements to visit can be made through the Hotel le Dauphin in Tolagnaro.

Schwitzer, pers. obs.). This species is sexually dichromatic. In males, the dorsal coat varies from dark chocolate-brown to black. The ventral coat is similarly colored. The ears have prominent tufts of long black hair. In females, the dorsal coat varies from golden-brown to chestnut-brown, lighter on the flanks but darker on the tail. The ventral coat is typically creamy white on the abdomen grading to cinnamon on the chin, and this coloration may continue to just below the eyes and ear tufts. The face is gray to black, the crown a darker charcoal-gray, and the ears are tufted with long white hairs. The eyes of both sexes are yellow-orange to deep orange. The black lemur hybridizes with E. flavifrons throughout a large part of the Manongarivo Special Reserve between Maromandia and Ambanja (Meyers et al., 1989; Rabarivola et al., 1991; Goodman and Schütz, 2000). Populations in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, just north of the Andranomalaza River, differ in fur coloration and the prominence of ear tufts compared to populations in the northern part of the range (Schwitzer and Lork, 2004). Eulemur macaco (and hybrids) is sympatric with E. fulvus on the Galoka, Manongarivo, and Tsaratanana Massifs, and in the Ifasy and Ramena river valleys, and with E. rubriventer on the Tsaratanana Massif (Tattersall, 1976b, 1982; Andrews, 1989; Birkinshaw et al., 2000; Goodman and Schütz, 2000). The black lemur can be distinguished from both of these congeners by its distinctive sexually dichromatic pelage and by the conspicuous ear tufts of both males and females.\n",
            "_natural_history":"The black lemur inhabits tropical moist lowland and montane forests from sea level to 1,600 m in the Sambirano region. It is quite adaptable and has been reported from primary forest, secondary forest, forest-agriculture mosaics, and timber plantations (Groves and Eaglen, 1988; Andrews, 1989). It is considered cathemeral, being active day and night throughout the year (Andrews and Birkinshaw, 1998; Colquhoun, 1998a). Group size ranges from 2 to 15 animals, the median range being 7–10 (Petter, 1962a, 1962b; Colquhoun, 1993). During the birth season, intergroup agonistic interactions are most directly related to food access compared with the mating season (Bayart and Simmen, 2005). Females give birth to a single young, usually between September and November (Petter and Petter, 1971). Fruits make up the bulk of its diet throughout the year, except for perhaps a month or so when leaves, seedpods, and nectar take on added significance and are also supplemented by fungi and invertebrates (Petter, 1962a, 1962b; Petter et al., 1977; Andrews and Birkinshaw, 1998; Simmen et al., 2007). Studies in Lokobe Strict Nature Reserve on Nosy Be and in the forests of the Ambato Massif suggest that the black lemur is a significant pollinator of the widespread traveler’s palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) and the legume (Parkia madagascariensis); as it feeds on nectar (Birkinshaw and Colquhoun, 1998). At Lokobe, it also appears to be the sole seed disperser for many tree species (Birkinshaw, 1999a). In Anpasilkely Forest, black lemurs obtain 150–190 kcal from the daytime diet during the birth season, and some introduced plant species were preferred (Simmen et al., 2007).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Northwestern Madagascar. The Mahavavy River is the northern limit of the range of E. macaco, and the Andranomalaza River forms part of the southern boundary. The eastern limit is poorly defined, but it likely occurs on the Tsaratanana Massif. In the southern part of its range, it intergrades with E. flavifrons in and around the Manongarivo Special Reserve (Meyers et al., 1989). It is found in the forests of the Ampasindava Peninsula, on the islands of Nosy Be and Nosy Komba, in the coastal forests northeast of Ambanja (including the peninsula leading to Nosy Faly), and it has been introduced to the small island of Nosy Tanikely, a local tourist attraction and dive-site (Koenders et al., 1985a; Mittermeier et al., 1994; Colquhoun, 1998b).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The IUCN Red List assessment of 2008 classified E. macaco as Vulnerable (VU). The principal threats are habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, and to hunting (both for food and as a pest). Hunting with traps seems to kill females preferentially, as they tend to lead group travel. There is also a small, but persistent, trade in black lemurs as pets (I. Colquhoun, pers. comm.). This species occurs in one national park (Sahamalaza- Iles Radama), two strict nature reserve (Lokobe and Tsaratanana) and in the Manongarivo Special Reserve (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Schwitzer and Lork, 2004; Schwitzer, 2006). In Manongarivo it is reported to be the most common lemur, diurnal or nocturnal (Raxworthy and Rakotondraparany, 1988). The species is also protected on the island of Nosy Komba, where the local people consider it sacred and where it serves as a major tourist attraction. As of 2009 there were an estimated 160 individuals in captivity worldwide (ISIS, 2009).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The best places to see the black lemur are on the islands of Nosy Be and Nosy Komba. On Nosy Komba, a largely degraded island, several groups of black lemurs come to a feeding site where tourists can offer them bananas sold by local villagers. The animals are habituated and will even sit on the visitor providing he or she remains calm. To see animals in more natural habitat, one can visit the Lokobe Strict Nature Reserve on Nosy Be, near the capital city of Hellville. Several enterprising villagers run tours to the edge of the reserve. They include an outrigger canoe ride, a walk in the forest (where the newly described Nosy Be sportive lemur, Lepilemur tymerlachsonorum, can readily be seen as well, even in the day), and a picnic. You can also overnight in two hotels on the Ampasipohy Beach, right at the edge of the reserve. Both of the sites described above are now on the regular tourist circuit and are a must for first-time visitors to Madagascar. A small population of introduced black lemurs on Nosy Tanikely near Nosy Komba is also easily observed.\n",

Randriatahina, pers. comm.). This species is sexually dichromatic. In males, the dorsal and ventral coats are black, the hairs sometimes tinged with brown, and a distinct ridge of hair on the forehead forms a noticeable crest. In contrast to E. macaco, with which it was long considered conspecific, there are no ear tufts. In females, the dorsal coat is reddish-tan to reddish-gray. The ventral coat is creamy-white to gray. The hands and feet are darker gray. The muzzle is slate-gray, the face lighter, and the crown rufous-tan. As with males, and again in contrast to female E. macaco, there are no ear tufts. The eyes of both sexes are blue to blue-gray, making this species one of the very few primates in the world that consistently has blue eyes, hence the common English name. The taxonomic status of this lemur has been debated since it was first described in the late 1800s. Due to the lack of locality data for the few museum specimens collected, nothing was known of its status in the wild until its “rediscovery” in 1983 (Tattersall, 1982; Koenders et al., 1985a). Subsequent genetic analysis indicated that it was distinct. It was at first separated as a subspecies (Fausser et al., 2000), but we elevate it here to a full species (Mittermeier et al., 2008c). The blue-eyed black lemur can only be confused with the black lemur, which is found just to its north and with which it is reported to hybridize in a large area of the Manongarivo Special Reserve. The lack of ear tufts in E. flavifrons and its striking blue-gray eyes readily distinguish it from Eulemur macaco.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Eulemur flavifrons inhabits more or less disturbed primary and secondary subtropical sub-humid forests, in a transition zone between the Sambirano region to the north and the western dry deciduous forests to the south. Its home range size and the way it uses its range differs between primary and secondary forest fragments, indicating that this species is somewhat able to adapt to different types of habitat. However, larger home ranges and lower densities of E. flavifrons in secondary forest as compared to primary forest suggest that the former is less suitable habitat for the species (Schwitzer et al., 2007a). During a 12-month study, E. flavifrons ate parts of 72 different plant species from 35 families; 52.3% of these were fruits, and 47.7% were leaves. The animals also fed on flowers, insects, insect excretions and fungi (Polowinsky and Schwitzer, 2009). The blue-eyed black lemur has a bimodal activity pattern, with peaks during the morning and evening twilight. It has activity bouts during the day and night year-round. Nocturnal illumination and the proportion of illuminated lunar disk are positively associated with the amount of nocturnal activity. Total daily activity, as well as nocturnal activity, is higher in secondary forest than in primary forest (Schwitzer et al., 2007b). At certain times of the year, this species may feed on large quantities of cicadas.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"In November, 1983, the blue-eyed black lemur was “rediscovered” in northwestern Madagascar in forests north of Befotaka and south of Maromandia, just south of the Sambirano region. Subsequent expeditions established its presence on the Sahamalaza Peninsula. The Andranomalaza River is the northern boundary of its range, the Maevarano River the southern boundary, and the Sandrakota River the eastern boundary, although it is reported to occur to the northeast of the Andranomalaza River, east of the Manongarivo Special Reserve as well (Petter and Andriatsarafara, 1987; Rabarivola et al., 1991; Andrianjakarivelo, 2004; Randriatahina and Rabarivola, 2004). A zone of hybridization or intergradation with E. macaco has been identified north of the Andranomalaza River in the Manongarivo mountains and the foothills of the southern Sambirano, including part of the Manongarivo Special Reserve (Meyers et al., 1989; Rabarivola et al., 1991; but see Schwitzer and Lork, 2004).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The IUCN Red List assessment in 2008 classified E. flavifrons as Critically Endangered (CR). It is also considered one of the most threatened primates in the world, having been included on the 2008 list of the world’s 25 Most Endangered Primates, drawn up every two years by the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group, the International Primatological Society, and Conservation International (Schwitzer et al., 2009). The principal threats to its survival are forest destruction due to slash-and-burn agriculture and selective logging, continued hunting and trapping, especially by the Tsimihety people in the eastern part of its distribution, and live capture for the local pet trade (C. Schwitzer, pers. comm.). Andrianjakarivelo (2004) found a density of up to 570 traps/km2 in certain areas. Parts of the distribution area of E. flavifrons received official protected area status in 2007 as the Parc National Sahamalaza-Iles Radama, including the Sahamalaza Peninsula and some mainland forests to the north and east (Lernould, 2002; Schwitzer and Lork, 2004; Schwitzer et al., 2006, 2009; C. Schwitzer, pers. obs.). The Sahamalaza Peninsula is also a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. As of 2010, there were about 75 individuals in captivity in Europe, North America and Madagascar (ISIS, 2009; I.

The Ankarafa Forest on the Sahamalaza Peninsula can be reached by a one-hour boat trip from Analalava to the small village of Marovato, and from there there is a hike of about two hours inland. Analalava is served by a regular ferry from Antsohihy. The Sahamalaza Peninsula can also be reached by pirogue from Maromandia. In the beginning of 2008, a local guide association was in the process of being formed, and use of local guides is indeed essential to find this species. Given the difficulty of finding this lemur, it is strongly recommended that a trip be arranged through Antananarivo-based tour operators.\n",

This species is sexually dichromatic. In males the dorsal coat is gray-brown, becoming a richer chestnut-brown on the flanks and the limbs, and darker on the tail. The ventral coat is a paler, creamy-gray. Only the tip of the muzzle is black, the face and ears being pale gray to white. An orange-brown, forward- pointing, V-shaped crown runs from the eyebrows alongside the ears and onto the cheeks. There is a dark gray to black patch in the center of the crown. In females, the dorsal coat, flanks, limbs, tail, top of the head and cheeks are gray. The tail darkens toward the tip. The ventral coat, face and ears are a paler gray to creamy-white. The nose is black and the muzzle dark gray. The V-shaped crown is chestnut-orange, but is less prominent than in the male and does not curve around to the cheeks. This species can be distinguished readily from Sanford’s brown lemur (Eulemur sanfordi), the only other Eulemur species with which it is sympatric, by its V-shaped crown, as well as by the absence of the white face that is so characteristic of male E. sanfordi.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Eulemur coronatus has been studied in the dry forests of Ankarana (Wilson et al., 1989; Hawkins et al., 1990) and Sakalava Bay (Arbelot-Traqui, 1983) and in the humid forests on Montagne d’Ambre (Arbelot-Traqui, 1983; Freed, 1996). Several estimates of population density have been made: 77 individuals/km2 in the Analamerana Special Reserve; 104 individuals/km2 in the humid forests of Montagne d’Ambre; and 221 individuals/km2 (and even higher in small areas of selectively logged forest) in the Ankarana Special Reserve (Arbelot-Tracqui, 1983; Fowler et al., 1989; Wilson et al., 1989). A more recent study at Analamerana (Banks, 2005) yielded estimates of 21–25 individuals/km2. Home range size is approximately 10–15 ha (Freed, 1996). This species is reported to inhabit all levels of the forest, but is most likely to be found in lianas, thick cover and terminal branches. It also readily descends to the ground to travel, or to eat fallen fruit or lick earth (Petter et al., 1977). The crowned lemur lives in most patches of forests throughout its range, accepting more open, dry habitat than the sympatric E. sanfordi, which is restricted to humid or gallery forests. It can even be seen delicately moving through some of the knife-edged karst tsingys that occur within its range, especially in the Ankarana region. Group size does not appear to differ significantly between habitat types, the average group being five or six and the maximum size about 15 individuals. Large multi-male/ multi-female groups often split into foraging subgroups of two to four individuals. Mixed species associations with E. sanfordi are reported during the wet season months when food resources are more readily available. According to Freed (1996) this species is cathemeral, remaining active both day and night throughout the year. Fruits make up the bulk of its diet, supplemented by young leaves, flowers, pollen and sometimes insects. Also, the crowned lemur tends to rely heavily on 10–20% of the nearly one hundred plant species it exploits, and feeds more on flowers during the dry season than at other times of the year. In Ankarana and Montagne d’Ambre mating occurs in late May and June, and births take place from mid-September through October. Gestation is 125 days (Kappeler, 1987). The crowned lemur is one of only three Eulemur species that show features of female dominance (Kappeler, 1993).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The crowned lemur occurs in the tropical moist and dry lowland and mid-altitude forests of extreme northern Madagascar, from sea level to 1,400 m. As far as is known, it is the only lemur found on the Cap d’Ambre Peninsula, the most northerly point on the island. From there, its range extends south along the east bank of the Mahavavy River beyond Ambilobe. The eastern part of its range extends south along the Manambato River, south of Daraina, to just north of Sambava.\n",

Langrand, pers. obs.). Hunting has recently emerged as a major threat in the Daraina area, where a number of animals were killed to serve a luxury restaurant trade in Sambava (Conservation International, 2010). The crowned lemur is found in two national parks (Ankarana and Montagne d’Ambre), two special reserves (Analamerana and Forêt d’Ambre) (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989), and in Daraina (Loky- Manambato Protected Area).

In Ankarana, several groups have been habituated in the area of the Campement des Anglais and Lac Vert, and they are easily found elsewhere in the park as well. In Montagne d’Ambre they can be seen quite close to the main campsite, the Station Roussettes, and the viewpoint overlooking the Grand Cascade (Garbutt, 2007). The species is also common in Daraina and easy to see there, although they are not as evident as Tattersall’s sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli).\n",

            "_identification":"Eulemur rubriventer is a medium-sized Eulemur with a head-body length of 35–40 cm, a tail length of 43–53 cm, a total length of 78–93 cm, and a weight of 1.6–2.4 kg (Glander et al., 1992; Terranova and Coffman, 1997). This species is sexually dichromatic. In males, the dorsal coat is long, dense, and a deep chestnut-brown. The ventral coat is slightly lighter and more reddish. The tail is darker, shading to black like the muzzle, face and head. Conspicuous patches of white skin form characteristic “tear-drops” beneath the eyes. There is no bushy beard or ear tufts as in other Eulemur species, but the fur around the ears is particularly dense and gives the head a robust appearance. In females, the dorsal coat and tail color are similar to those of the male, but the ventral coat is a highly contrasting creamy-white that may extend all the way to the cheeks. Facial coloration is also similar to that of the male, except that the white patches beneath the eyes are reduced. The head appears less robust, as it lacks the long bushy cheek hairs of the male. Over its relatively large range, the red-bellied lemur is sympatric with four other Eulemur species: E. albifrons in the northern part of its range, E. fulvus toward the middle of its range, and E. rufifrons and E. cinereiceps in the southern part. It can be distinguished from all of them by its dark luxurious coat and the male’s conspicuous white eye patches. Males from the region of Andasibe (= Périnet) appear to have a more distinctive reddish belly compared to populations found farther south, such as in Ranomafana National Park (O. Langrand, pers. obs.).\n",
            "_natural_history":"The red-bellied lemur has been the subject of several field studies in Ranomafana National Park since the mid- 1980s (Meier, 1987; Dague and Petter, 1988; Overdorff, 1988, 1991). Its activity pattern is cathemeral, animals being active both day and night throughout the year (Overdorff and Rasmussen, 1995). The diet consists principally of fruit, flowers, nectar, and leaves of more than 70 different plant species, including introduced species such as Chinese guava (Psidium spp.), and it is also considered a good seed disperser. Invertebrates may also be a significant part of the diet at certain times of the year. Group size varies from two to 10 individuals, the typical group containing an adult pair and their offspring. Densities of approximately 5 individuals/km2 have been recorded at Ranomafana (Irwin et al., 2005). Home range size has been estimated at 12–15 ha. Groups travel and feed as single units throughout this home range, led primarily by females. Young are born in September and October, and they ride as often on the male as on the female for the first five weeks. After this time, females often reject the infants, while males may carry them up to the age of 100 days. Usually only one infant is born per year to each group, and mortality is approximately 50%.\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The range of E. rubriventer extends from northern Madagascar’s Tsaratanana Massif south along the thin strip of eastern rain forest to the Pic d’Ivohibe Special Reserve and the Manampatrana River (Irwin et al., 2005), although at one time it apparently reached as far as the Mananara River (Petter and Petter, 1971; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996). It does not occur on the Masoala Peninsula. This species appears to be thinly distributed and restricted to intact forests, and is usually considerably rarer than other sympatric Eulemur. It occurs at altitudes of up to 2,400 m on the Tsaratanana Massif.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"According to the most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008), E. rubriventer is Vulnerable (VU). The principal threats to its survival are habitat loss due to slash-and- burn agriculture and illegal logging, and hunting, which can be heavy in certain areas. This species is found in five national parks (Andringitra, Mantadia, Marojejy, Ranomafana, and Zahamena), two strict nature reserves (Tsaratanana and Zahamena), and six special reserves (Ambatovaky, Analamazaotra, Anjanaharibe-Sud, Mangerivola, Marotandrano, and Pic d’Ivohibe) (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Schmid and Smolker, 1998). As of 2009, there were approximately 165 individuals reported in zoological collections worldwide (ISIS, 2009).\n",

When the Chinese guava is in fruit (May and June), red-bellied lemurs are usually easy to find around the Belle Vue site feeding along with E. rufifrons (see Garbutt, 2007). This species also can be seen on occasion in the Analamazaotra Special Reserve, in Mantadia National Park, and in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve in northeastern Madagascar, but it is quite rare in these reserves.\n",

The species is sexually dichromatic. In males, the dorsal coat is gray-brown and darker at the tip of the tail. There is also a darker pygal patch. The back of the neck and shoulders are often a rufous brown. The ventral coat is a paler creamy-gray. The muzzle and face are gray. The rufous cheeks and beard are the most distinguishing features of the male. A triangular bald patch on the top of the head sometimes results from excessive rubbing during scent-marking. In females, the dorsal coat is gray and lighter than that of the male, but females share the darker tail and dark gray pygal patch, as well as a lighter, cream-colored abdomen. The muzzle is light gray, the face a darker, slate gray that is surrounded by a white bushy beard that extends to the ears and reaches down the throat and onto the forelimbs. The eyes are reddish-orange in both sexes. North of the Betsiboka River this species is sympatric with the brown lemur, E. fulvus, which has a darker coat and is not sexually dichromatic. South of the Betsiboka River, E. mongoz is sympatric with the rufous brown lemur, E. rufus, with which it is unlikely to be confused, unless one gets only a fleeting glimpse of the animal. However, Zaramody and Pastorini (2001) report a small zone of hybridization between the two species. The mongoose lemur tends to be more cryptic in its behavior and lives in smaller groups than the other Eulemur species with which it is found. In the Comoros, where this species also occurs, it is the only lemur on the islands of Mohéli and Anjouan, and cannot be confused with any other species.\n",
            "_natural_history":"This species is found in tropical dry deciduous forests in western Madagascar and can also survive well in secondary forest (Petter, 1962a, 1962b; Tattersall, 1976a). It lives in small cohesive family units of an adult pair with one to four offspring (Curtis and Zaramody, 1999). Its activity pattern, variously described in earlier studies, is now understood to be cathemeral (Curtis et al., 1999; Rasmussen, 1999). Fruit, flowers, nectar, leaves, and leaf petioles constitute the bulk of the diet, which may include relatively few species of plants (Tattersall and Sussman, 1975; Andriatsarafara, 1988; Curtis et al., 1999). Mongoose lemurs have sometimes been observed intermingling with E. fulvus groups during feeding bouts (Harrington, 1978b), but usually keep to themselves and are much quieter than sympatric brown lemurs. The birth season appears to be around mid-October and it seems that females give birth each year (Tattersall, 1976a).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"Eulemur mongoz is found in northwestern Madagascar. It is also one of only two lemur species found outside Madagascar, with populations occurring in the Comoros on the islands of Mohéli and Anjouan, where it was almost certainly introduced by our own species prior to European arrival. In Madagascar, it occurs in the region of Ambato- Boéni and Ankarafantsika, where the remaining forests are highly fragmented (Petter et al., 1977; Tattersall, 1982). The northern limit of its distribution appears to be near Analalava on the Bay of Narindra. It is also found south and west of the Betsiboka River at Katsepy and on the shores of Lac Kinkony, on both sides of the Mahavavy River, and in the Tsiombikibo Classified Forest near Mitsinjo (Müller et al., 2000).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"In 2008, the IUCN Red List assessment classified E. mongoz as Vulnerable (VU). The principal threats are habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, burning to create pasture for cattle, charcoal production, and hunting for food. While previously under less threat on Anjouan and Mohéli, this species is increasingly seen as a crop pest, especially by an influx of Malagasy who do not adhere to local customs that have historically provided lemurs in the Comoros a greater degree of protection (Tattersall, 1998). The mongoose lemur occurs in just one protected area, Ankarafantsika National Park. Unprotected populations are found in the forests of Anjamena, Antrema (at Katsepy), Mariarano, and Tsiombikibo (near Mitsinjo). As of 2009, there were 111 mongoose lemurs reported in zoological collections worldwide (ISIS, 2009). ￼\n",

The station is about a two-hour drive from Mahajanga along the main highway to Antananarivo, and there is now comfortable lodging available. Other potential viewing sites are in the Tsiombikibo Classified Forest northwest of Mitsinjo, around Lac Kamonjo approximately 90 km west of the Betsiboka estuary, and in the Anjamena Forest on the eastern bank of the Mahavavy River (Garbutt, 2007), but access to these sites is largely limited to the dry season.

As its common English name suggests, the coat of this animal is black and white. The hair is black on the abdomen, tail, extremities, inner aspects of the limbs, forehead, circum-orbital area, and top of the head. In contrast, the back, flanks, rump and most of the hindlimbs are usually white. The shoulders are black and there is a thick white longitudinal band in the center of the back, the latter distinguishing V. v. variegata from V. v. editorum. This pattern may vary according to locality, and intermediate forms may exist. The coat is exceptionally fluffy, the tail is long and bushy, and the ears are lavishly tufted, or “ruffed,” with long, thick white hair. There is no difference between the sexes in size or coloration.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Varecia v. variegata has been studied in Betampona (Britt, 1997, 2000; Britt et al., 2003). Long-term field research shows significant variation in home range size, group size and territorial behavior. This lemur is highly frugivorous and also feeds on nectar, seeds and leaves, according to the season. Its locomotion is largely quadrupedal with occasional bouts of leaping. Females usually give birth to twins, which are left in a nest when young and afterwards carried in the mother’s mouth (Petter et al., 1977). Ruffed lemurs are probably the only primates that build nests exclusively for the birth and the first few days of infant-rearing (Pereira et al., 1987; Morland, 1990).\n",

The Anove River (between Soanierana Ivongo and Mananara) is the northern part of its range, while the southern part consists of the region south of Mananjary as far as the Manampatrana or Mananara Rivers (Vasey and Tattersall, 2002). This range is now highly fragmented.\n",
            "_conservation_status":"According to the most recent IUCN Red List assessment (2008), V. v. variegata is Critically Endangered (CR). The main threats are habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining, but hunting is also a major factor and can be very heavy in certain areas. What is more, stochastic events such as cyclones can severely impact small populations (Balko, 1998; Ratsimbazafy, 2002). Varecia v. variegata is found in Zahamena National Park, two strict nature reserves (Betampona and Zahamena), and two special reserves (Ambatovaky and Marotandrano) (E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.). Individuals with the variegata coat pattern are also found in protected areas further south, well inside the range of V. v. editorum, with which the subspecies may overlap. This needs further investigation, but if there is actual sympatry, these subspecies will require recognition as full species. On the other hand, it may be that there is so much variation within this species that recognition of any subspecies is inappropriate. Final decisions on this issue cannot be made at this time. Varecia v. variegata (unlike the other two V. variegata subspecies) is one of the most common lemurs in captivity (ISIS, 2009). However, although these animals do very well in zoos and breed readily there, the widespread problem of mixed or unknown ancestry greatly increases the likelihood of accidental inbreeding. In November, 1997, individuals of this subspecies that had been born and raised in U.S. zoological institutions were returned to Madagascar and released in the Betampona Strict Nature Reserve (Britt et al., 2003). A study of this reintroduction effort is ongoing. As of 2009, there were approximately 770 individuals reported in zoological collections worldwide (ISIS, 2009).\n",

On this island, the animal exhibits a “fission/fusion” social system, in which larger communities of up to 16 individuals split into smaller core-groups during times of the year when fruits are scarce, a behavior that may enhance foraging efficiency for each individual lemur. These core groups are not cohesive and continue to fission and fuse back together again. Although females usually give birth to twins, short- term data suggest that females do not always reproduce successfully every year, and that a typical mother raises only one infant every second year. The diet consists mainly of ripe fruits, and it appears that only a small number of tree species are exploited.\n",

Indeed, recent studies of villages in the Makira Forest have found that ruffed lemur meat is a desired food item and that current levels of hunting are unsustainable (Golden, 2005). This lemur occurs in the Mananara-Nord National Park, the Nosy Mangabe Special Reserve, and in the soon-to-be protected forests of Makira.

Good camping facilities are available, but camping permits must be obtained from the local Madagascar National Parks office for overnight stays. A number of convenient tent platforms are provided. A motorized pirogue trip from Maroantsetra up the Antainambalana River may also be worthwhile, but finding this species on the mainland is much more difficult than on Nosy Mangabe. Excursions to Nosy Mangabe and longer trips can be arranged through the local Madagascar National Parks office, through local hotels (especially the Relais de Masoala), and with the Association des Guides de Maroantsetra. This ruffed lemur is much more challenging to observe in the wild in Mananara-Nord National Park, as there is little infrastructure in place to facilitate visits. A permit is required from the UNESCO office in Mananara or from Madagascar National Parks in Antanambe. Access to the park is possible via a three-hour walk from Sandrakatsy, a small town served by taxi-brousse from Mananara. Once in the park, there are no good trails and this lemur is usually one of the most difficult to find. Use of a local guide is essential.\n",

            "_identification":"Varecia rubra is a large quadrupedal lemur with a head-body length of 50–55 cm, a tail length of 60–65 cm, a total length of 100–120 cm, and a weight of 3.3–3.6 kg (Vasey, 2003). The dominant coat color is a deep chestnut-red (but sometimes also red-orange or honey-blonde) that covers much of the dorsal body surface, as well as the legs, throat, cheeks and ear tufts (Vasey, 1997a). The ventral coat is black, as are the tail, insides of the limbs, feet, face, muzzle, and top of the head. In addition, there is a white patch on the neck, and small lighter-colored patches may also be present on the heels, digits and muzzle. Variations in color pattern are well known in this species, but do not appear to have a clear geographic pattern. As with Varecia variegata, the red ruffed lemur is difficult to confuse with any other lemur. It is sympatric with the white-fronted brown lemur, Eulemur albifrons, but is larger, has the characteristic ear tufts, and lacks the striking white face. What is more, its raucous vocalizations are unmistakeable.\n",
            "_natural_history":"Varecia rubra typically inhabits tropical moist lowland forest up to 1,200 m. It has been studied in the forests of Ambatonakolahy (Rigamonti, 1993) and Andranobe (Vasey, 1997a) on the Masoala Peninsula. It is diurnal, prefers tall forest, and is often observed in the crowns of large feeding trees. Population density has been variously estimated at 6 individuals/km2 (Rakotondratsima and Kremen, 2001), 21–23 individuals/km2 (Rigamonti, 1993), and 31–54 individuals/km2 (Vasey, 1997b). Ruffed lemurs move quadrupedally through the canopy most of the time, leaping occasionally. Suspensory postures are common during feeding bouts (Vasey, 1999). These are the most frugivorous of Madagascar’s primates, with as much as 75–90% of their diet consisting of fruit. Flowers, nectar, and leaves make up the balance. Females are reported to consume more low-fiber, high protein items (young leaves and flowers) prior to giving birth and during lactation, presumably to meet the higher energy demands of reproduction (Vasey, 2000a, 2002). At Andranobe, 132 different species from 36 plant families were eaten over the course of a year (Vasey, 2000b). Reproduction varies considerably between years (Rakotondratsima and Kremen, 2001; Vasey, 2007). The mating season is May–July, with births occurring from September through early November after a gestation period of about 102 days. In captivity, litters range from one to five infants, but are usually two or three, each newborn weighing just under 100 g (Brockman et al., 1987b; Schwitzer, 2003). In the wild, mean litter size of red ruffed lemurs is 2.11 (Vasey, 2007), while in captivity it is 2.22 (Rasmussen, 1985). Field observations indicate that this species is polygamous, and that multiple individuals participate in caring for the young (Vasey, 1997a, 2007). Social organization is described as fission/fusion; communities are usually multi-male/multi-female, and number 5–31 individuals. Home ranges cover 23–58 ha and appear to be defended (Rigamonti, 1993; Vasey, 2006). Scent-marking tends to take place during territorial battles and female greeting displays. This species’ vocal repertoire is extensive and is employed in numerous contexts. The most characteristic vocalization is the very loud and raucous call, which appears to be used in territorial encounters and for purposes of intragroup spacing (Vasey, 2003).\n",
            "_geographic_range":"The red ruffed lemur has a very restricted range, inhabiting only the remaining primary forests of the Masoala Peninsula and the region immediately north of the Bay of Antongil in northeastern Madagascar (Petter and Petter-Rousseaux, 1979; Tattersall, 1982). It once may have occurred as far north as Antalaha, but this is uncertain (Tattersall, 1977a). The Antainambalana River appears to separate V. rubra from V. variegata subcincta, but the western limit of the red ruffed lemur’s range remains unclear. The confluence of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers has been investigated as a possible contact or hybrid zone between these two forms, but results are inconclusive (Tattersall, 1982; Lindsay and Simons, 1986; Hekkala et al., 2007; Vasey and Tattersall, 2002).\n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified V. rubra as Endangered (EN). The principal threats are habitat loss and hunting (Simons and Lindsay, 1987; Rigamonti, 1996; Vasey, 1996, 1997b). Due to its large size and evident need for tall primary forest, it is particularly susceptible to human encroachment and, sadly, hunting of this unique and important species still takes place. Needless to say, a major effort is needed to eliminate hunting of this important flagship species. Furthermore, because remaining populations are concentrated on the Masoala Peninsula, the red ruffed lemur may be threatened by the frequent cyclones (hurricanes) that hit this part of Madagascar. It is protected only in the Masoala National Park (Kremen, 1998). Ironically, this species, with its very restricted range, was always considered more threatened than the more widely distributed black-and-white ruffed lemur. Whereas all three subspecies of V. variegata are now considered Critically Endangered, the most recent IUCN assessment places V. rubra in the Endangered category, in large part because of its presence in a major national park. However, this now needs to be reassessed. Masoala was the national park most impacted by the very rapid upsurge of illegal logging after the political events of early 2009, and this logging has continued well into 2010. It is highly likely that it is being accompanied by at least some hunting, which will almost certainly push V. rubra into the Critically Endangered category. As of 2009, there were 590 red ruffed lemurs reported in captivity worldwide (ISIS, 2009). Such populations in American and European zoos represent a safeguard against extinction, but they are unfortunately very limited their genetic diversity (Schwitzer, 2003).\n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The only place to see red ruffed lemurs is on the Masoala Peninsula. Boat trips can be arranged from Maraontsetra to Ambanizana, Lohatrozona or Tampolo where there are several rustic but comfortable lodges. A nice package trip is to spend one night on Nosy Mangabe, which is quite close to the Masoala Peninsula, and then do a day visit to the Masoala to any of the previously mentioned sites. This species is relatively easy to find due to its loud vocalizations, which can often be heard from far away.\n",

This species is slightly larger and darker than Avahi occidentalis. It has dense short fur, tightly curled on the back. The dorsal coat is gray-brown to reddish, becoming paler towards the tail, which is a rusty- red. The chest and abdomen are gray. The face is brownish, with a lighter band or distinct patches above the eyes and lighter fur on the cheeks and throat. The ears are small and largely hidden by the thick fur.\nThe eastern woolly lemur is most likely to be confused with eastern rain forest species of Lepilemur, which also adopt a clinging posture when at rest, and, to a lesser extent, Cheirogaleus. Avahi can be distinguished from Lepilemur by its concealed ears and generally woollier appearance, its distinctive white thigh stripe, and by the fact that it is often seen huddled closely together with other group members, a behavior rarely observed in Lepilemur. Cheirogaleus is considerably smaller, does not employ the vertical clinging posture, is not a leaper (although it will occasionally jump from branch to branch), and has contrasting white underparts. \n",
            "_natural_history":"Avahi laniger occurs in tropical moist lowland and\nmontane forests, as well as secondary forest formations.\nMembers of this genus typically eat flowers and fruits to a\nsmall extent, but the diet consists primarily of leaves, which\nprovide a low level of nutrition for a primate of such small\nsize (Ganzhorn et al., 1985; Harcourt, 1991). Some biologists believe that this explains their relatively low level of activity, even during waking hours at night. During the day, woolly lemurs typically sleep in clumps of dense foliage, sometimes fairly close to the ground, and usually huddled together (Albignac, 1981b). \n",
            "_geographic_range":"Prior to the recent taxonomic splitting of this species, A. laniger was thought to range almost the entire length of Madagascar’s eastern rain forests, from the Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) region in the extreme south to as far as the Ankarana Massif in the extreme north (Petter et al., 1977; Tattersall, 1982; Fowler et al., 1989; Hawkins et al., 1990). With the description of a number of new species within this large area, it is now thought to range from the Bemarivo River in the north to the Nesivolo/Mangoro in the south (E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs). \nGroups of up to five have been reported, and home ranges of 1–2 ha are aggressively defended (Albignac, 1981b; Razanahoera-Rakotomalala, 1981; Ganzhorn et al., 1985). Longitudinal and genetic data are needed to better understand their social behavior. Research at the Analamazaotra Special Reserve provides estimates of densities reaching 72–100 individuals/km2, and suggests a social organization based on monogamous pairs and their offspring (Ganzhorn, 1988).\nSingle births take place in August and September (Ganzhorn et al., 1985). Infants initially cling to the mother’s abdomen, but are eventually carried on her back (Ganzhorn 1988; Harcourt, 1988, 1991). \n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (2008) classified A. laniger as Least Concern (LC). However, we believe that this assessment needs reconsideration, especially given some of the recent hunting data that has emerged. It suffers mainly from habitat destruction due to logging and slash-and-burn agriculture, it is sometimes captured opportunistically at its daytime sleeping sites or in traps baited with fruit, and in some places it is pursued by hunters with slingshots (Mananara-Nord) or spears (Makira). Avahi laniger is reported from four national parks (Mananara-Nord, Mantadia, Marojejy and Zahamena), two strict nature reserves (Betampona and Zahamena) and five special reserves (Ambatovaky, Ambohitantely, Analamazaotra, Anjanaharibe-Sud, and Mangerivola) (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Schmid and Smolker, 1998; Britt et al., 1999; CBSG, 2002; Andriantompohavana et al., 2007; Lei et al., 2008; J. U. Ganzhorn, pers. comm.; P. C. Wright, pers. comm.). It is unclear which woolly lemur is present in the Ankarana Special Reserve.

As with most other Avahi this nocturnal species can readily be observed during the day as well, especially with the assistance of knowledgeable local guides. Its sleeping sites are often just a few meters above the ground, and the animals usually remain there if not disturbed.\n",

Territorial defense appears to be less vigorous and vocal than in eastern rain forest Avahi, with greater overlap between neighboring groups. Ganzhorn (1988) estimated population densities in Ankarafantsika at 67 individuals/km2.\nYoung leaves and buds seem to be preferred food items, probably accounting for three- quarters of the dietary intake. More than 20 plant species have been documented as food items, many of which do not appear to be common in the surrounding forests (Albignac, 1981b; Razanahoera-Rakotomalala, 1981; Thalmann, 2001).

They believe that the isolated population much farther north in the Ankarana region may also be this species, but that, in between, A. unicolor inhabits both the Ampasindava Peninsula and the Sambirano region, including the Manongarivo Special Reserve (Schmid and Smolker, 1998; Sterling and McFadden, 2000; Thalmann and Geissmann, 2000). \n",

It occurs in the Ankarafantsika National Park, the Bora Special Reserve, the Mariarano Classified Forest (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Randrianambinina et al., 2003c; E. E.

It has a head-body length of 40–48 cm, a tail length of 50–60 cm, a total length of 90–110 cm, and a weight of 3.0–3.5 kg (Tattersall, 1982; Kappeler, 1991; Richard et al., 2000, 2002). The pelage is long and thick, and the predominant coat color, including the tail, is white. This contrasts sharply with the black face, muzzle, hands and feet, the dark brown crown that extends down the nape of the neck in both sexes, and the reddish-brown patch found on the upper chest of males that is associated with their sternal glands. Fur on the ears is white and slightly tufted. Fur on the ventral surface is sparse, giving the abdomen a grayish appearance due to the underlying dark skin.\nA distinctive color variant has been described and given the name P. verreauxi majori Rothschild, 1894, but most experts now consider it to be nothing more than a melanistic form of Verreaux’s sifaka (Tattersall, 1982; Mittermeier et al., 1994; Groves, 2001). This “majori” variant is also predominantly white, including the cheeks, ears and forehead, but has a chocolate-brown head cap, and is brownish to brownish-black on the chest, back, inside of the arms and legs, and tail, except for its white tip. It is almost always found in groups of normally colored P. verreauxi (F. Hawkins, pers. obs.).\nEntirely white individuals are also occasionally observed in the midst of normally colored animals (e.g., in Berenty, R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.). Despite the variations of color that exist in this species, it is impossible to confuse it with any other lemur in its range. \n",
            "_natural_history":"Verreaux’s sifaka is a diurnal lemur that typically inhabits tropical dry lowland and montane forest (from sea level to 1,300 m), including spiny bush, brush-and scrub thickets, and riparian forests (Sussman et al., 1987), but it is also known from humid forests at low altitudes (Rasoarimanana, 2005). It tends to live in small- to medium-sized multi-male groups that range from 2–14, but average 5–6 individuals (Jolly, 1966; Richard, 1974a, 1985). Females appear to be dominant over males. Home ranges may exceed 10 ha but are often very much smaller (Richard et al., 1993; Carrai and Lunardini, 1996, Raharivololona and Ranaivosoa, 2000). Core areas of overlapping home ranges are defended against neighboring sifaka groups (Benadi et al., 2008). Population densities have been estimated at 47 individuals/km2 in the degraded forests of Belaoka, at 150–200 individuals/km2 in Berenty (Jolly et al., 1982b; O’Connor, 1987), and at 400–500 individuals/km2 at Antserananomby (Sussman, 1974).\nThe diet is seasonally variable but consists principally of leaves, fruit, and flowers. Leaves are the most important food item during the dry season and fruit during the wet season, at which time this sifaka also appears to use fewer plant species (Richard, 1977). Most seeds consumed are destroyed, meaning that this species is at least partly a seed predator (Ralisoamala, 1996). The survival of Verreaux’s sifaka in Didiereaceae forest suggests that it does not need to drink and can survive severe drought (Jolly, 1966). Richard (1974b) suggested that water may be obtained during the dry season by eating the bark and cambium of Operculicarya decaryi.\nThe ability of this sifaka to leap from trunk to trunk of spiny, cactus-like plants of the family Didiereaceae, such as Alluaudia ascendens and Alluaudia procera, is one of the most spectacular wildlife phenomena to be observed in Madagascar. These tall thin plants are covered with very hard sharp spines, yet the sifakas are able to leap from one trunk to the next with apparently no concern and without sustaining any injuries. On the ground, Verreaux’s sifaka moves bipedally, bounding on its hindlimbs, usually sideways, with its arms raised above its head. This is a very different spectacle from leaping between the spiny trunks of Alluaudia, but it is equally impressive and has become one of the best known and most appealing symbols of Madagascar’s wildlife.\nThe age at which sexual maturity is reached varies with habitat. For example, in the spiny forests of Beza-Mahafaly, fewer than half the females have reproduced by six years of age (Richard et al., 2002), whereas at Berenty three-year-old females are routinely seen with newborns (Jolly, 1966). Breeding is seasonal. Mating occurs in January and February, with births occurring 162–170 days after conception (Richard, 2003). A single dominant male monopolizes paternity in each group in Kirindy (Kappeler and Schäffler, 2008), whereas paternity by extra-group males is common in the Beza-Mahafaly population (Lawler et al., 2003). Infants ride on their mother’s belly until about three months of age, at which point they shift to her back. They are almost completely independent at six months (Jolly, 1966). These sifakas sometimes fall victim to the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) (Rasoloarison et al., 1995; Karpanty and Goodman, 1999); they have specific alarm calls for the latter (Fichtel and Kappeler, 2002). Individuals also occasionally fall prey to the large Madagascar ground boas (Acrantophis madagascariensis, Acrantophis dumerili) when they descend from the trees (L. A. de Roland, pers. comm.). \n",
            "_geographic_range":"Southern and southwestern Madagascar. The Tsiribihina River is believed to be the northern limit of the range of Verreaux’s sifaka in the west. In the southeast, it is found near to (just north of) Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) in the Nahampoana Private Reserve, although it was probably introduced there and is not a part of its historical range. Tolagnaro is in the rain forest zone where P. verreauxi does not otherwise occur. The range limit in the southeast is the transitional and spiny forest patches of the Mangatsiaka Parcel of Andohahela National Park, which is a 1–11⁄2 hour drive from Tolagnaro. It is not found in the rain forest parcel of the park (Petter et al., 1977; O’Connor et al., 1986, 1987), and the eastern limit is the Tsimehaly Parcel in the Anosy Range (about 40 km west of Tolagnaro). Population densities vary in different forest types, but even very small forest patches can support sizeable populations. \n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified P. verreauxi as Vulnerable (VU). Despite its wide distribution, the two principal habitats upon which it depends—spiny forest and riparian or gallery forest—are under continual threat because of logging, slash-and- burn agriculture (especially for corn plantations) and charcoal and fuelwood production (Sussman and Richard, 1986). Although hunting of P. verreauxi is “fady” (taboo) to several of the tribes living within its range (e.g., Antandroy, Mahafaly), it is hunted by other tribes (e.g., Sakalava) and by immigrants to the region (Goodman and Raselimanana, 2003; Goodman et al., 2004). In the Isalo region, this lemur is known as “sifaka-bilany” (“sifaka of the cooking pot”) but it is unclear whether this is because of its popularity as a food item or because of the sooty black appearance of individuals from this part of the species’ range (J. Ratsimbazafy, pers. obs.; P. C. Wright, pers. comm.).\nPropithecus verreauxi occurs in four national parks (Andohahela, Isalo, Tsimanampetsotsa, and Vohibasia-Zombitse), two special reserves (Andranomena and Beza-Mahafaly), two private reserves (Analabe and Berenty), in the large new Menabe- Antimena Protected Area (which contains the Kirindy Forest), and in a number of unprotected classified forests and forest reserves (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Fenn et al., 1999; Hawkins, 1999; Goodman and Raselimanana, 2003; Sussman et al., 2003).\nAs of 2010, this species was not being kept in captivity (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.). \n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"Not only is this lemur one of the most appealing and attractive animals in Madagascar, it is also one of the easiest to see. It is most readily observed in the Berenty Private Reserve west of Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin), with sightings guaranteed even on a day trip. At Berenty, it is usually seen in gallery forests in the main part of the reserve, but can also be found in small patches of Didiereaceae bush adjacent to gallery forest, and even around the camp clearings. Indeed, several groups of this species “dance” across roads and through the lodge areas in Berenty every day, usually in the early morning or late afternoon.\nA particularly interesting site to visit is the Anjapolo section of the Berenty Reserve, some 15 km from the main lodge area. There the animal can be see in a beautiful old stand of spiny forest, much more impressive than the spiny forest usually visited by tourists.\nTwo places to see Verreaux’s sifaka in large impressive stands of Didiereaceae bush are at Mangaziaka and Ihazafotsy at the edge of Parcel 2 of Andohahela National Park, and in the region surrounding the Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve some five to six hours by car east of Toliara (= Tuléar). It can also readily be seen in the Kirindy Forest north of Morondava, where there are several habituated groups, and it is now routinely seen in the forested canyons of Isalo National Park as well. Another good location is the Nahampoana Private Reserve, just north of Tolagnaro (= Fort-Dauphin) where it was probably introduced. \n",

The coat is creamy-white, which contrasts strongly with the chocolate-brown to black head, neck and throat. The muzzle is blunt and rounded, and even bulbous in form, and the face is naked and black. The bulbous nose is quite unusual and readily distinguishes this sifaka from all others. There is sometimes a patch of white fur across the bridge of the nose and slight white tufting around the ears. The body coat is variably tinted golden-yellow to golden-brown on the upper chest, shoulders and upper forelimbs. The hindlimbs and tail are white.\nThe crowned sifaka is easy to distinguish from most other lemurs in its range, but may be confused with Decken’s sifaka (Propithecus deckenii) in areas where the ranges of the two species approach one another or even overlap.

The most comprehensive surveys of the distribution of P. coronatus and P. deckenii have been compiled by Thalmann et al. (2002). In addition, Petter and Andriatsafara (1987) report that it was present in the Ambohitantely Special Reserve (on the high plateau) until perhaps midway through the last century, but it is now gone from this small, isolated locale. \n",

There is also some live capture for the illegal pet trade (L. Dollar, pers. comm.).\nThere are reports that this species occurs in two special reserves (Ambohijanahary and Kasijy), but its status in these protected areas remains to be determined (Randrianarisoa et al., 2001a, 2001b; Thalmann et al., 2002). Efforts should be made to secure protection for the populations at Katsepy and Anjamena that have been the subject of brief studies and are also visited by tourists. Katsepy is considered a sacred site by some local people and is thus afforded a certain level of protection, and the Antrema Forest Station is the subject of a conservation program supported by Vincennes Zoo. A few classified forests within the crowned sifaka’s range may also harbor viable populations and should be surveyed (Mittermeier et al., 1994).\nAs of 2009 there were 17 individuals reported in captivity in Europe, with an additional two in the Lemurs’ Park near Antananarivo, Madagascar (I.

The comfortable and recently established Chez Chabaud Hotel is the only local accommodation. The proprietor is able to arrange transportation to and from the forests that harbor these animals, and they can sometimes also be seen in walks along the shore. A visit to Katsepy requires two days and a one-night stay, and can be arranged from Mahajanga. Katsepy is also a good site for the mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz), which is quite easy to see in this area.\n \nAn even more accessible site for viewing this species, as well as the crowned lemur (Eulemur coronatus), is in the nearby Belamboka- Bombetoka Forests. The area can be reached via Boanamary, which is 27 km to the west of RN4, and has basic, community-managed tourism facilities in Mataitromby. The animals are very easy to observe if you are ready to walk 30 minutes. Fanamby is developing community-based ecotourism in the area and local guides are available (S. Wolhauser, pers. comm.).\nThe forests of Anjamena, on the east bank of the Mahavavy River, are also fairly easy to reach, and the prospects are good for viewing sifakas. Getting to and from the Mahavavy River delta requires expedition-level preparation and is now being offered by a small number of international tour operators, largely for the area’s birdlife, but recent reports indicate that substantial numbers of lemurs are also observed during these trips. \n \n",

Coquerel’s sifaka feeds mostly on young\nleaves, flowers, fruit, bark and dead wood in the wet season, and on mature leaves and buds in the dry season (Richard, 1974b). As many as 98 different plant species have been recorded in its diet (Richard, 1978a, 1978b).\nBirths are clustered in the months of June and July, and studies in captivity suggest a gestation period of 162 days (Richard, 1976, 1987). Infants cling to their mother’s chest for the first month or so, and then transfer to her back. They become completely independent by about six months of age and reach adult size in one year. \nAs with other western sifaka species, P. coquereli regularly goes to the ground. Interestingly, its ground locomotion is somewhat different from that of Propithecus verreauxi further to the south.

Its restricted distribution makes this sifaka particularly susceptible to habitat loss and hunting. Slash-and-burn agriculture and annual burning to create new pasture for livestock are the principal causes of forest loss in northwestern Madagascar, but trees are also cut to produce charcoal. All of these practices threaten even officially protected areas. In some areas local traditions place taboos on hunting sifakas, but immigration to this region continues to change such long-held customs, and hunting of this species does take place (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989).\nThe only two protected areas in which P. coquereli is known to occur are the Ankarafantsika National Park and the Bora Special Reserve (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Randrianambinina et al.,\n2003c). Unfortunately, hunting\npressure on sifakas is significant in Ankarafantsika (Garcia and Goodman, 2003) and Bora has become seriously degraded.

Now, however, hunting has perhaps become the most significant threat, especially by itinerant gold miners. Although gold miners were not observed to hunt this animal in 1995 during a period of intense mining activity (indeed, they even fed these animals every day in their camps near Daraina, R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.), more recent information indicates that these miners may have become a problem, at least in some areas.\nA new conservation site to protect this species was declared in the Daraina region in June 2005, thanks largely to the efforts of Association Fanamby, a Malagasy non-governmental organization, and Conservation International.

Glander, pers. comm.). Comparing maximum weights for the largest diademed sifakas and the largest indris, it appears that the largest indris exceed the largest diademed sifakas in size by a kilogram or less, so these two species are quite similar in size. Propithecus diadema is also one of the most colorful and attractive of all the lemurs. Its coat is long and silky. The forehead, cheeks and throat are white, and a black crown may extend down the nape of the neck. The muzzle is short, the dark gray to black face is bare, and the eyes are reddish-brown. The shoulders and upper back are slate-gray, the lower back lightening to silver-gray. The flanks and tail are pale gray to white, and the base of the tail is often golden-yellow. The arms and legs are orange to yellow-gold, and the hands and feet are black. The ventral coat typically is white to pale gray. Males possess a large reddish-brown cutaneous gland in the middle of the throat, and a perianal patch of similar color is also believed to be glandular (Petter, 1962a). This large and distinctive sifaka cannot be confused with any other lemur. \n",
            "_natural_history":"This species has only once been studied for a significant period of time (Powzyk, 1996, 1997; Powzyk and Mowry, 2003). It is diurnal, appears to require intact rain forest, and lives in multi-male/multi-female groups of eight or more individuals that defend home ranges of 20–50 ha by means of scent-marking. The diet consists mainly of fruits, seeds, flowers and young leaves, their respective proportions varying according to seasonal abundance. The number of plant species used each day often reaches 25 or more, including fruits of two preferred species, the seeds of which contain significant levels of alkaloids. Compared to the sympatric, similar-sized Indri indri, P. diadema eats higher-energy foods and spends more time actively patrolling and defending its territories. The mean daily path length of 1,629 m for P. diadema can be compared to 774 m for I. indri. \n",
            "_geographic_range":"Despite the fact that the precise limits of its range are unknown, the diademed sifaka is believed to be the most widely distributed member of the genus Propithecus. It occurs in Madagascar’s eastern rain forests from the Mangoro and Onive rivers north to the Mananara River, inhabiting forests from 200–1,600 m. Historically, its range extended farther north to the Antanambalaina River (Petter et al., 1977; Petter and Petter-Rousseaux, 1979; Tattersall, 1982), but the species can no longer be found there (D. Meyers, pers. comm.). At the southern limit of its range there may be some hybridization between P. diadema and Propithecus edwardsi (Andriaholinirina et al., 2004).\nAn unusual population of P. diadema can be found in the\nforests of Tsinjoarivo in south-central Madagascar, about a\nfour-hour drive from Antananarivo. The Tsinjoarivo animals\nare quite variable in color, including even at least one all\nblack individual, which indicates that they may represent a\nhybrid population between P. diadema and P. edwardsi. One preliminary genetic study (Mayor et al., 2004) did not find sufficient evidence to warrant its recognition as a new taxon, whereas another more recent study indicated that it is in fact distinct (Y. Rumpler, pers. comm.). We await a final decision on this population, but in the meantime continue to include it within P. diadema. Illustrations of it are given in Figures 10.59 and 10.60). \n",

It has also been successfully reintroduced into the Analamazaotra Special Reserve at Andasibe; it once occurred naturally in this area but was extirpated 30–40 years ago. The reintroduction was carried out by E. E. Louis Jr. and a team of Malagasy researchers in 2007 with animals rescued from the nearby Ambatovy mine site.\nAdditional populations have been identified in two classified forests (Andriantantely and Tsinjoarivo), the Marokitay Forest Reserve, and in the unprotected\nforests of Anosibe an’ala, Didy, Iofa, Maromiza and Sandranantitra (Lehman and Wright, 2000; Conservation International, 1999; Andriamasimanana et al., 2001; Andriaholirina et al., 2004; Garbutt, 2007). The Tsinjoarivo Classified Forest has been recommended as a new protected area, based on the presence of the unusual population of diademed sifakas found there.\nAs of 2010 only two individuals of this species were found in captivity, one in the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina USA, and the other on Lemur Island, part of the Hotel Vakona in Andasibe, Madagascar (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.). \n",

However, in recent years the number of opportunities has increased, with the best place to see it now being  \nMantadia National Park. Local guides from the Association des Guides d’Andasibe have habituated several groups at km 15, and finding them is not difficult if accompanied by these experienced guides. This site is 15 km north of Andasibe (= Périnet) and can be included in a visit to see the indris at Analamazaotra. The trip can be arranged through any Madagascar tour operator, Madagascar National Parks, or the Association des Guides d’Andasibe. \nIt can now also be seen quite easily in the main indri viewing area in Analamazaotra, thanks to the above-mentioned reintroduction program, and in the new protected area of Anjozorobe-Ankavo, located on the high plateau, about a 90-minute drive from Antananarivo, and managed by Fanamby. \n",

It has a head-body length of 42–52 cm, a tail length of 41–48 cm, a total length of 83–100 cm, and a weight of 5.0–6.5 kg (Glander et al., 1992; Lehman et al., 2005a). Its dorsal coat is dense and dark, varying from chocolate- brown to almost black on the head, upper body, limbs, and tail. Bilateral whitish patches of varying extent grade into the darker surrounding fur on the back and flanks, sometimes meeting along the spine. The ventral coat is equally dark, sometimes paler around the area of the chest, but less dense than the dorsal coat. The face is bare and the skin is dark gray to black, as are the ears that are barely discernible above the dark fur of the head. The eyes are orange-red. This species is very distinctive and cannot be confused with any other sympatric species.\nIn the past, some authors recognized another closely-related sifaka subspecies from the forests of Nandihizana, an animal described as Propithecus diadema holomelas Günther, 1875. It was all black in color except for a dark brown patch at the base of the tail. Tattersall (1986) regarded P. d. holomelas as nothing more than a color variant of P. edwardsi (formerly P. d. edwardsi). On the other hand, Groves and Helgen (2007) found that animals fitting the holomelas description were generally smaller in size, and preferred to keep the question of its validity open. Unfortunately, sifakas are now gone from this region and no similarly-colored animals have been found elsewhere, making it difficult to determine whether or not this animal is (or was) a distinct taxon. \n",
            "_natural_history":"Field studies of P. edwardsi have been carried out at Ranomafana National Park (Wright et al., 1987, 1997; Wright, 1995, 1998; Hemingway, 1995, 1996). There it is found in primary and secondary forests at middle to high elevations (600–1,600 m). The typical group size is 3–9, and groups range over areas of 100–250 ha. Population density estimates are relatively low at 8 individuals/km2. There are healthy populations south of Ranomafana National Park as well, but densities are also very low. \nInfants typically are born in June and July. They transfer from their mother’s belly to her back after about three to four weeks, and ride comfortably there at about two months of age. Infant mortality has been calculated at almost 50% before the age of one year. Predation, especially by the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), is a significant cause of mortality, but some infant losses are also attributable to infanticide by unrelated male sifakas.\nThe diet consists mostly of leaves, fruit, seeds, and flowers, with approximately a dozen different plant species being sampled each day. However, dietary composition appears to vary significantly, not only from month to month but also from year to year (Hemingway, 1995, 1996). \n",
            "_geographic_range":"Milne-Edwards’ sifaka is found in the rain forests of southeastern Madagascar. The Mangoro and Onive rivers are the northern limits of its present range and the Rienana River in Andringitra National Park is its southern limit. Its former range probably extended further south to the Manampatrana River (Tattersall, 1982), but populations in that region appear to have been extirpated. Andriaholinirina et al. (2004) found apparent intermediates between P. diadema and P. edwardsi at Anosiben ‘Ifody, on the left bank of the upper Mangoro River, whereas typical P. edwardsi were observed further south along this river where it turns east towards the sea. \n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified P. edwardsi as Endangered (EN). Habitat destruction for slash-and-burn agriculture and also for logging and gold mining are the main threats, and sometimes take place even in protected areas. Hunting is also a problem, with shotguns, blowguns and slingshots used as weapons to bring down these animals (P. C. Wright, pers. comm.). This species is known to occur in two national parks (Andringitra and Ranomafana) (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Sterling and Ramarason, 1996). It may also occur in Andohahela National Park (O’Connor et al., 1986, 1987), but this has not yet been verified (Feistner and Schmid, 1999). The Ranomafana National Park population is estimated at 4,500 and the total population for the species at 9,000 (P. C. Wright pers. comm.). Populations in unprotected forests north of Ranomafana include those near the villages of Kirisiasy, Marofotsy, Fandriana and Marolambo (Irwin et al., 2000; Lehman and Wright, 2000; E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.). The forests of Marofotsy should be added to Ranomafana National Park. In addition, a number of forest reserves in eastern Fianarantsoa Province still harbor populations of P. edwardsi and these could be included in a conservation corridor linking Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks (Mittermeier et al., 1994; P. C. Wright, pers. comm.).\nAs of 2010, this species was not being kept in captivity (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.). \n",

Finding it is relatively easy with the help of local guides, and virtually guaranteed if one devotes two days to the visit. Another excellent site is the forestry station of Ialatsara, 6 km north of Ambohimasoa on the main road from Antananarivo to Fianarantsoa. This site has a tented camp and several habituated sifaka groups that are readily observed. \n",

It has a head-body length of 48–54 cm, a tail length of 45–51 cm, a total length of 93–105 cm, and a weight of 5.0–6.0 kg (Lehman et al., 2005a). Males and females are similar in size. The pelage is long and silky, which gives this species its common English name. It is a truly remarkable and attractive creature that looks more like a plush toy than a real animal. In some individuals, silver-gray tints may appear on the crown, back and limbs, and the pygal region (at the base of the tail) is sometimes yellow. The muzzle and face are bare, the skin a mix of pink and black, with some individuals having all pink and some all black faces. The tips of the naked black or pink ears protrude just beyond the white fur of the head and cheeks. This species does not occur with any other sifaka and cannot be confused with any other lemur within its range.\nThe silky sifaka may be the only member of its genus to show extreme individual variation in partial skin pigmentation loss, known as leucism. Although all infants are believed to be born with predominantly black faces, with age some individuals lose their pigmentation and show varying degrees of pink patches. The first western explorer to observe the silky sifaka (Alfred Grandidier, in 1871) believed that it was an albino subspecies of the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). We now know that silky sifakas are not albinos. All individuals have some skin pigment, and photo-phobic individuals have never been observed (Milne-Edwards and Grandidier, 1875; Cousins, 2007).\nUnlike P. perrieri and P. edwardsi, where adult males and females are difficult to distinguish, adult male and female P. candidus can be readily distinguished from one another by the color of the fur on the upper chest. Adult males have a large brown patch on their chest that results from scent-marking with the sternal-\ngular gland. As rates of male scent-marking increase during the mating season, the patch on the male’s chest becomes larger and may even cover the entire front torso to the abdomen (Patel, 2006a). \n",
            "_natural_history":"Propithecus candidus has been discussed in several survey reports (Safford et al., 1989; Duckworth et al., 1995; Sterling and McFadden, 2000), and two short-term studies (Kelley and Mayor, 2002; Queslin and Patel, 2008). A 14.5-month study was carried out by E. R. Patel in Marojejy National Park, including a detailed 12-month dietary study (E. R. Patel, pers. comm.). In Marojejy and in Anjaraharibe-Sud, animals are encountered in mountainous primary rain forest at altitudes between 700 and 1,900 m. They may sometimes be found in sclerophyllous forest, near their highest elevations. The southernmost silky sifakas in Makira adjacent to the Antainambalana River inhabit an unusual, low-elevation forest fragment at altitudes of 300 to 600 m. Despite its extreme rarity, this species has the greatest elevational range of any sifaka. \nAs with other eastern sifakas, P. candidus has a variable social structure, living in both pair-bonded and multi- male/multi-female groups of up to nine individuals. Home range size varies by site, ranging from 34 to 47 ha (Patel and Andrianandrasana, 2008).\nApproximately 25% of the day is spent feeding and 44% resting, with 31% being devoted to other activities such as social behavior, travelling, and sleeping. Long bouts of terrestrial play involving adults are not uncommon (Patel, 2006b). Rates of aggression are low, and mainly occur during feeding. Females have feeding priority over males. Like other eastern sifakas, P. candidus is a folivorous seed predator that eats a very large variety of plant species. A recent 2-month study documented feeding from 76 species in 42 families (mainly trees, but many lianas and epiphytes as well). The most important plant families in the diet were Moraceae, Fabaceae, Myrtaceae, Clusiaceae, and Apocynaceae. Fruit from Pachytrophe dimepate, seeds from Senna sp., young leaves from Plectaneia thouarsii, and fruit from Eugenia spp. were the four foods most preferred, and accounted for roughly 37% of total feeding time. Overall, 52% of feeding time was spent eating leaves, 34% fruit, and 11% seeds. Flowers and soil were eaten rarely (Queslin and Patel, 2008). Preliminary results from an ongoing, detailed 12-month dietary study suggest general similarity in diet with P. diadema and P. edwardsi (E. R. Patel, pers. comm.).\nMating is believed to occur on a single day each year in December or January, with infants born in June or July. Generally, females give birth to a single infant every two years; only occasionally in consecutive years (Patel, 2006b). Infants initially grasp the fur on their mother’s belly, and about four weeks later begin to ride jockey-style on their mother’s back. As is typical of Propithecus, all group members interact affiliatively with infants. \nGrooming is the most frequent form of non-maternal infant care, followed by playing and occasional carrying as well as nursing in a few remarkable instances (Patel, 2007a). Although in eastern sifakas generally both male and female group members disperse, female dispersal has not yet been observed in this particular species (E. R. Patel, pers. comm.).\nThe fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) is the only documented predator of the silky sifaka, other than human beings (Patel, 2005). No aerial predation attempts by raptors have ever been observed, although these sifakas sometimes stare skyward and emit “aerial disturbance” roars in the presence of the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) (Patel et al., 2003a). Acoustic analyses have revealed sex and individual differences in the structure of the silky sifaka zzuss vocalization (Patel et al., 2005b, 2006). The adult vocal repertoire has seven different calls, a much smaller number than has been observed in Lemur catta and Varecia (Patel et al., 2005c).\nEastern sifakas have several scent-marking glands that include a sebaceous chest gland only found in males, and mixed apocrine-sebaceous genital glands in both sexes. Sifakas, in contrast to Eulemur, do not allomark by directly scent-marking conspecifics. Females scent-mark trees by rubbing their genital glands against them in a rhythmic vertical motion. Males, for their part, scent-mark trees in several different ways, by rubbing them with their chest gland, with their genital glands, or with a combination of the two. Males routinely gouge trees with their toothcombs just prior to chest-marking, which leaves long-lasting visible marks (Patel and Girard-Buttoz, 2008). Both sexes often urinate while scent- marking. Although males scent-mark two or three times as often as females, female scent marks are responded to far more often and more quickly than male marks. Males commonly overmark a female’s mark, followed by males overmarking the scent-marks of other males (Patel, 2006a; Patel and Girard-Buttoz, 2008; Ritchie and Patel, 2006). \n",
            "_geographic_range":"The silky sifaka has a very restricted range in northeastern Madagascar that includes the humid forest belt extending from Maroantsetra to the Andapa Basin and the Marojejy Massif (Tattersall, 1982). Most of the remaining population is found in the humid, mountainous forests in Marojejy National Park and Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve. Currently, Marojejy is the northern limit of the species’ distribution, although historic range maps suggest that it once occurred as far north as the Bemarivo River, near Sambava (Milne-Edwards and Grandidier, 1875). The Androranga River may be the northeastern range limit in the Tsaratanana Corridor, though further surveys are needed to confirm this. The Antainambalana River in the Makira Forest Protected Area is currently regarded as the southern limit (Patel and Andrianandrasana, 2008; Rasolofoson et al., 2007a, 2007b; Wilmé and Callmander, 2006). The northeastern range limit of this species in Makira was only recently established, when a few groups were found in the Antohaka Lava Forest. Informal reports suggest that the unprotected Maherivaratra Forest, outside northeastern Makira, may also contain silky sifakas (E. R. Patel, pers. comm.). \n",
            "_conservation_status":"The IUCN Red List assessment of 2008 classified P. candidus as Critically Endangered (CR). This is one of the rarest and most endangered sifakas, and has been on the list of the world’s 25 Most Endangered Primates (produced jointly by the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group, the International Primatological Society, and Conservation International) since its inception in 2000 (Patel, 2009a). The world population is believed to be only a few hundred animals, and it is threatened by habitat destruction and hunting, even in protected areas. There is no local taboo or “fady” against eating this species, as exists for the indri in at least some parts of its range (Patel et al., 2005). The situation has become even more severe since the political upheavals of early 2009. The majority of the silky sifakas occur in Marojejy National Park and Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve. Marojejy was one of the first protected areas to be hit by a wave of illegal rosewood logging shortly after the coup that ousted President Marc Ravalomanana. It is very possible that hunting of this species accompanied these incursions, but this remains to be confirmed (Patel, 2007b; Patel, 2009).\nA few groups have also been found in the Makira Forest Protected Area and in the Betaolana Corridor. Several unprotected forest fragments southeast of Marojejey, such as Andranomenabe and Maherivaratra, probably contain a few silky sifaka groups and require additional surveying. Efforts should be made to stop the hunting of sifaka in Marojejy and elsewhere.\nSilky sifakas have never survived long in captivity, and there are none in zoos (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.). \n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"This sifaka, rare and localized as it is, is relatively easy to see in Marojejy National Park. A visit of at least one night, and preferably two or three, is nevertheless required to find it. Comfortable bungalows and kitchen facilities are available at each of the three main camps. These can be reserved at park headquarters located on the main road between Andapa and Sambava. From the headquarters one drives in as far as the village of Mandena if road and bridge conditions permit, and from there it is about another 2.5-km walk to the park entrance itself and another 4.5 km to the first campsite, Camp Mantella. From there it is another 2 km to Camp Marojejia, which is the best location for finding the silky sifaka. This camp is situated in the transition from lowland to montane rain forest, and must be one of the most beautiful in Madagascar. A large, covered dining area is perched on a mountainside with views overlooking sheer rock outcrops and lush vegetation.\nThis species may also be seen in the northwest portion of the park in the direction of Doany, but this site remains far off the traditional tourist circuit and requires expedition- level preparations. Other remote locations are in the Befingotra Forest of the Anjanaharibe- Sud Specieal Reserve, as well as in the Andaparaty Forest of Makira. \n",

The total population could be as few as 500 and the effective breeding population only 125 individuals. The species is most abundant in semi- evergreen forests on sandstone that comprise only one quarter of its remaining habitat, and these forests are also under the heaviest pressures from humans. Slash-and-burn agriculture is the greatest threat, and this is exacerbated by fires set to increase pasture, by logging, by cutting of trees for charcoal production, and by forest destruction by itinerant miners. Local hunting may be a problem as well, especially considering the tiny remaining population (Fowler et al., 1989; Harcourt and Thornback, 1990; Mayor and Lehman, 1999).\nThe only protected area where Perrier’s sifaka is found for certain is the Analamerana Special Reserve (Ganzhorn et al., 1996/1997), but a small population may still occur in the eastern section of the Ankarana National Park, which is connected through a series of forest patches to populations at Andriafiamena and Analamerana. It has recently been seen in unprotected forest patches between Analamerana and Ankarana (D. Meyers, pers. comm.). It also occurs in the Andavakoera Classified Forest, but probably in very low numbers.\nThere is an urgent need for a full-time, long-term scientific presence in the Analamerana Special Reserve, as well as an expansion of this protected area to include the forests of Andriafiamena and a connection to Ankarana. Unfortunately, it appears that some logging is taking place in Andriafiamena, but Association Fanamby has been working to have this area protected.

Analamerana itself is not very difficult to reach, the turnoff being located about one hour south of Antsiranana (= Diégo-Suarez) on the main highway, and then another one-to-three hours depending on the final destination. However, once you turn off the secondary road driving conditions can be very poor, especially if there has recently been a heavy rain.\nExcursions to the Analamerana Reserve can be arranged by local tour operators based in Antsirananana. They provide for overnight camping and will also arrange local guides and four-wheel-drive transportation. Camping overnight and using a local guide are essential, and it may be necessary to hike several hours to observe this sifaka. However, the reserve is rich in other lemurs as well, including both crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus) and Sanford’s brown lemurs (Eulemur sanfordi), in addition to a number of nocturnal species.\n \n",

E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.). The high end of the weight range makes it the largest of the living lemurs, but a big diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) approaches it in size. It is a typical vertical clinger and leaper, with long hind limbs compared to its trunk and forelimbs, and a preference for postures in which the trunk is held vertically. Coat color varies from predominantly black, contrasting with a white pygal patch and a broad, paler facial ring, to variegated black-and-white, the white areas corresponding to the occipital cap, a collar extending up to and beyond the ears, and the outer surfaces of the legs and lower arms (Groves, 2001). The ears are black, modestly tufted, and highly visible. The earliest indris to be described exhibited the darker color pattern, which is typical of museum specimens from Andapa and Maroantsetra, and has also been observed in wild populations from Anjanaharibe-Sud (Thalmann et al., 1993; R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.), Makira (D. Meyers, pers. comm.), Ambatovaky, and Anjozorobe (F.

It is easily distinguished from the similar-sized, lighter-colored diademed sifaka, Propithecus diadema, by its prominent ears, long muzzle and vestigial tail, which contrasts strongly with the long tail of all Propithecus species. Varecia variegata also has a black-and-white color pattern but has a long tail, moves quadrupedally, and is smaller.\nIn the Analamazaotra Special Reserve and in the Anjozorobe-Angavo Protected Area, the male indri is slightly larger than the female, but there is\nno difference between the sexes in color pattern. Male and\nfemale indris can be distinguished, however, by their wailing\nsong. Both sexes participate in the song in a coordinated\nmanner but they differ in the presence or absence of note\ntypes, in the acoustic features of note types, and in the\nnumber of notes emitted (Giacoma et al., 2010). \n",
            "_natural_history":"The indri has been studied in the forests of Analamazaotra (Pollock, 1975a, 1975b, 1977, 1979a, 1979b, 1986a) and in the nearby Mantadia National Park (Powzyk, 1996, 1997; Powzyk and Mowry, 2003). In this region it lives in groups of 2–6 individuals, normally consisting of a monogamous adult pair, although changes in partners have been observed, and changes in group composition are quite frequent (V. Sorrentino, pers. obs.). Although groups in fragmented habitat have been reported to be larger than those in more extensive, undisturbed areas (Pollock, 1979a, 1979b; Powzyk, 1997), this is not always the case (V. Sorrentino, pers. comm.) The female appears to be the dominant member of the pair, normally feeding higher in the trees than the male, and having priority access to food sources. The diet consists primarily of immature leaves supplemented by flowers, fruit, seeds and bark, which vary in proportion according to season. Every day the indri descends to the ground to eat soil, which may help it detoxify seeds that it has eaten (Powzyk, 1997; Britt et al., 2002; Powzyk and Thalmann, 2003). Although this behavior was once rarely seen by the tourist groups at Analamazaotra, it has become increasingly common in recent years as the animals have become fully habituated to the daily tours (R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs). Individuals at Analamazaotra and Anjozorobe also sometimes travel bipedally on the ground in the same way that Verreaux’s sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) do at Berenty (F. Hawkins, R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.). Home ranges average 18 ha in the fragmented forests of Analamazaotra, but can be as large as 40 ha in the more pristine forests of Mantadia, where day ranges of 300 to 800 m are common. Before dusk the group retires to a sleeping tree, bedding down at heights of 10–30 m, the female typically with her offspring and separated from the male by 2–50 m.\nSpacing between groups may be conditioned by the famous loud morning calls, which are answered from as far as 3 km away. Indris call most during the austral summer, typically between 06:00 and 13:00 hours (and sometimes as early as 04:45 in the warmest months, R. A. Mittermeier, pers. obs.), with most activity occurring between 7:00 and 11:00 hours, and occasional bouts between 14:30 and 16:30 (Powzyk, 1997; Garbutt, 2007), but vocal activity sometimes lasts throughout the night (F. Hawkins, pers. obs.). These calling bouts appear to be effective in maintaining territorial spacing, and may help explain the relatively small degree of range overlap between neighboring groups. Moreover, acoustic-structural differences in the song of males and females can convey sex information that is potentially meaningful to the other group members or to other groups (Rendall et al. 2004; Norcross et al., 1999; Giacoma et al., 2010).\nFemales give birth every two to three years. Reproduction is highly seasonal, with the birth of a single offspring in May or June after a gestation period of 120–150 days. Infants ride on the mother’s ventrum up to the age of four to five months, then transfer to the back. By eight months they are moving independently, but they stay close to the mother until well into their second year (Pollock, 1975a, 1975b). Reproductive maturity is reached between seven and nine years of age (Pollock, 1977a, 1977b). This slow reproductive rate means that indris, in theory, have more difficulty bouncing back from hunting pressure than smaller, more rapidly maturing species, and is a critical factor to take into account in designing conservation programs on their behalf. \n",
            "_geographic_range":"Indri indri inhabits tropical moist lowland and montane forests of eastern Madagascar up to elevations of 1,800 m (Goodman and Ganzhorn, 2004a, 2004b). Its range extends from the Anosibe an’ala Classified Forest in the south to the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve in the north (Petter et al., 1977; Tattersall, 1982; Powzyk and Thalmann, 2003). It does not occur on the Masoala Peninsula or in Marojejy National Park, despite the latter area being connected to forest less than 40 km away where the species is present. Subfossil evidence indicates that indri once occurred in the interior of Madagascar at least as far west as the Itasy Massif, southwest to Ampoza-Ankazoabo (Tattersall, 1982; Godfrey et al., 1999) and north to the Ankarana Massif (Jungers et al., 1995). \n",
            "_conservation_status":"Indri indri was classified as Endangered (EN) in the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment. The principal threat to this species is habitat destruction for slash-and-burn agriculture, logging and fuelwood, with destruction of this kind occurring even in protected areas. However, contrary to what was believed in the past, hunting is also a major problem for the indri in certain areas. Although it was long thought to be protected by local “fady” (traditional taboos), these do not appear to be universal and it now appears that the indri is hunted even in some areas where taboos exist. In many places, these taboos are breaking down with cultural erosion and immigration, and local people often find ways to circumvent taboos even if they are still in place. For example, a person for whom eating the indri is forbidden may still hunt the animal to sell it to others, while those who may be forbidden to kill indri can still purchase them for food. Recent studies of villages in the Makira Forest indicate that indri were also hunted in the past for their skins (worn as clothing), that indri meat is prized and fetches a premium price, and that current levels of indri hunting are unsustainable (Golden, 2005). Given the enormous importance of this animal as a flagship species for conservation and as a symbol for Madagascar in general, special efforts should be made to put in place and strongly enforce a national ban on hunting.\nThe indri occurs in three national parks (Mananara-Nord, Mantadia and Zahamena), two strict nature reserves (Betampona and Zahamena), five special reserves (Ambatovaky, \nAnalamazaotra, Anjanaharibe-Sud, Mangerivola, and Marotandrano) and in the Anjozorobe-Angavo Protected Area (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Powzyk, 1997; Schmid and Smolker, 1998; Britt et al., 1999; CBSG, 2002). The corridor between Mantadia and Zahamena has also been proposed as a new conservation site, and the Anosibe an’ala Classified Forest should be considered for the creation of a reserve as well. The indri also occurs in the Makira Forest, another proposed protected area, but hunting pressure there appears to be especially heavy (C. Golden, pers. comm.).\nAs of 2010, this species was not being kept in captivity (I. J. Porton, pers. comm.). Indeed, the indri is one of the few primate genera that has never been kept successfully in zoos, all previous attempts having failed after only a short period of time. \n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"The classic site for viewing indri is the Analamazaotra Special Reserve at Andasibe (= Périnet). No trip to Madagascar is complete without a visit there to see this spectacular animal, surely one of the most attractive, appealing and unusual creatures in the Animal Kingdom. What is more, Andasibe is one of the most accessible sites in Madagascar, and can be easily reached by road from Antananarivo in two and a half hours. There are three lodges to choose from: the up-scale Vakona Hotel, the simple but comfortable Hotel Feon’ny Ala, and the quaint Mikalo Hotel, which also has a row of higher quality, recently-built chalets. Another hotel, Euphonia, is located along the main highway right before the turnoff to Andasibe, and is also a good place to stay. Employing a local guide makes finding the indri a virtual certainty. The local guides have organized themselves into three organizations, all of which can provide excellent service to visitors. The oldest is the Association des Guides d’Andasibe. The second is Association Mitsinjo, which operates its own private reserve right across the road from Analamazaotra, and the third, recently created, is the Association Tambatra. All three are a very positive force for conservation in this region.\nAn excellent site for seeing the black form of the indri is Anjozorobe-Ankavo, located on the high plateau about 90 minutes by car from Antananarivo. Association Fanamby has built a comfortable lodge there, and both black indri and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) are easy to locate and observe. \nOne of the best places to see indri in the northern part of its range is the Anjanaharibe- Sud Special Reserve, about 15 km southwest of Andapa. Unlike the Andasibe animals these are not yet habituated to human presence, so visitors should count on spending several days to ensure a sighting. They are also common in the Zahamena National Park and the Zahamena Strict Nature Reserve, but these areas are much more difficult to reach. The largest indris come from the Marotandrano Special Reserve, again an area that is very difficult to reach. \n",

            "_identification":"The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is one of Madagascar’s truly unique flagship species, and the most unusual and distinctive primate on Earth. A medium-sized lemur, with a head-body length of 30–37 cm, a tail length of 44–53 cm, a total length of 74–90 cm, and a body weight of 2.5–2.6 kg (Glander, 1994; Mittermeier et al., 1994; Feistner and Sterling, 1995). The aye-aye is immediately recognizable by its prominent black, highly mobile ears, its long thin fingers and toes, and its long bushy tail. Its overall appearance is a dark grayish-brown. The dorsal coat, including that of the limbs, consists of a dense layer of short, off-white hairs overlaid by a longer, coarser layer of blackish- brown, white-tipped guard hairs, giving the animal a brindled appearance. The tail is darkly colored and its hairs are monochromatic. The ventral coat is similar to the dorsal coat in hair pattern, but not as dense, and turns whiter on the chest, throat and face. The muzzle is short and thinly haired, and the nose is pink. The elongated digits (save for the thumb) bear laterally-compressed, claw-like nails, and the third digit of the hand is particularly unusual, being skeletal in appearance. The incisors are large, rodent-like, and continuously-growing, the only primate with this feature. The mammae are inguinal.\nIt is very difficult to confuse the aye-aye with any other lemur, unless only the most superficial glimpse of this species is obtained in the forest at night. It is by far the largest fully nocturnal lemur, being more than double the size of Avahi and Lepilemur, and its large eyes shine back very brightly in a flashlight beam. Similarly-sized Eulemur species are sometimes active at night, and may briefly be thought to be aye-ayes. However, they usually move about in groups, do not have the strong eye-shine of the aye-aye, and will be quickly recognized for what they are; usually to the disappointment of the primate-watcher. \n",
            "_natural_history":"The aye-aye is quite adaptable and is known from a variety of habitats, including primary rain forest, deciduous forest, secondary forests, cultivated areas, dry scrub forest, coconut groves, and mangrove swamps (Sussman et al., 1985; Harcourt and Thornback, 1990; Ancrenaz et al., 1994; Andriamasimanana, 1994). Southern spiny forest seems to be the only habitat in which the species does not occur.\nThe presence of aye-aye in many areas appears to be determined largely by its primary food source, the seeds of ramy (Canarium spp.), but this is not always the case (Iwano et al., 1991; Sterling, 1998). Other dietary staples include seeds of Orania trispatha and Terminalia catappa, beetle and moth larvae embedded in trees and bamboo, cankerous growths on Intsia bijuga, nectar from Ravenala madagascariensis, and a variety of crops such as coconuts, lychees, and mangos (Petter, 1977; Constable et al., 1985; Sterling, 1993b, 1994b; Sterling et al., 1994). Finger-tapping along the surface of branches and tree trunks helps an aye-aye locate hollow interiors and the insect larvae living in them (Erickson, 1998). It then uses its continuously growing incisors to gnaw through outer bark and its skeletal middle finger to extract the prey inside. This is sometimes done by rapidly vibrating the middle finger to extract the desired food item. Signs of aye-aye presence include holes gnawed in trees, dead wood and hard-shelled fruits.\nThe aye-aye spends up to 80% of the night traveling and feeding. During the day it sleeps in nests, tree forks or vine tangles (Petter and Petter, 1967; Petter, 1977). Nests may be occupied for a few days at a time and several individuals may use the same nest at different times. Males occupy much larger home ranges than females; 125–215 ha compared to 30–40 ha (Sterling, 1993). Interestingly enough, aye-ayes appear to spend more time moving on the ground than any other lemur except Lemur catta (Sussman, 1977; Sterling, 1993a).\nAye-ayes may not be as solitary as originally believed, with some studies suggesting foraging in tandem and differing relationships between animals of the same sex (Sterling and Richard, 1995). There does not appear to be a restricted mating season, and a single infant is produced once every two to three years (Petter and Peyriéras, 1970b). \n",
            "_geographic_range":"Daubentonia madagascariensis was once believed to be very rare and primarily a denizen of Madagascar’s eastern rain forests (Petter and Peyriéras, 1970b). However, since the 1980s it has been found in new localities in many different parts of the country (Sterling, 1994a). Recent confirmed sightings document the aye-aye’s presence in the eastern forests from Ampanefana in the north to Andohahela National Park in the south, and in the western and northern forests from Montagne d’Ambre in the north to at least Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park in the south (Ganzhorn and Rabesoa, 1986a, 1986b; O’Connor et al., 1986; Iwano et al., 1991; Duckworth, 1993; Simons, 1993; Duckworth et al., 1995; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Schmid and Smolker, 1998; Sterling and Rakotoarison, 1998; Sterling and MacFadden, 2000; Sterling, 2003; Rahajanirina and Dollar, 2004). There are also two introduced island populations, one on Nosy Mangabe off the coast of northeastern Madagascar in the Bay of Antongil (according to Mittermeier et al. [1992], nine individuals introduced in 1966), and the other on “Aye-aye Island” (also called Ile Roger) at the edge of the town of Mananara-Nord, also in northeastern Madagascar (Petter, 1977; Bradt, 2007). Current opinion is that the aye-aye may be the most widely distributed of Madagascar’s lemurs. Nonetheless, it is rare everywhere, and its numbers are believed to be declining with continued habitat loss and hunting. \n",
            "_conservation_status":"The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified D. madagascariensis as Near Threatened (NT), a status that we believe to be incorrect. Based on more recent evidence, we believe that it should now be placed back in the Endangered category. Once regarded as one of the world’s most endangered mammals, the aye-aye has now been shown to be much more widespread than previously believed. Half a century ago, some experts thought it might even be extinct, until a population was discovered in the Ambato Mahambo Forest in eastern Madagascar in 1957, although that population ultimately vanished (Petter and Petter, 1967; Petter and Peyriéras, 1970b). In the mid-1960s, nine animals were trapped in coastal forests between Toamasina (= Tamatave) and Maroantsetra and introduced onto the island of Nosy Mangabe as a safety measure to prevent its extinction. Whether the species formerly existed on the island remains uncertain, but later expeditions confirmed that the animal had survived there and appeared to be reproducing (Bomford, 1976, 1981; Constable et al., 1985), and this population still exists today.\nDespite the aye-aye’s wide distribution, it is still killed in some areas as a harbinger of evil and as a crop pest (e.g., coconuts, lychees). Habitat destruction also threatens it \nthroughout its range (Albignac, 1987; Harcourt and Thornback, 1990; Simons, 1993; Simons and Meyers, 2001; Koenig, 2005), with trees such as Intsia bijugia and Canarium madagascariensis, dietary staples for the aye-aye, being cut preferentially for the construction of boats, houses, and coffins (Pollock et al., 1985; Iwano and Iwakawa, 1988). Recent evidence also indicates that it is hunted for food in some areas (e.g., Makira, C. Golden, pers. comm.). \nDaubentonia madagascariensis is reported to occur in close to 30 protected areas, including 13 national parks (Andohahela, Andringitra, Mananara-Nord, Mantadia, Marojejy, Masoala, Midongy du Sud, Montagne d’Ambre, Ranomafana, Sahamalaza-Iles Radama, Tsingy de Bemaraha, Tsingy de Namoroka, and Zahamena), four strict nature reserves (Betampona, Tsaratanana, Tsingy de Bemaraha, and Zahamena), and 13 special reserves (Ambatovaky, Analamazaotra, Analamerana, Anjanaharibe-Sud, Ankarana, Bora, Forêt d’Ambre, Kalambatritra, Manombo, Manongarivo, Marotandrano, Nosy Mangabe, and Pic d’Ivohibe) (Nicoll and Langrand, 1989; Mittermeier et al., 1994; Rakotoarison, 1995b; Sterling and Ramaroson, 1996; Schmid and Smolker, 1998; Britt et al., 1999; Thalmann et al., 1999; CBSG, 2002; Randriananbinina et al., 2003c; Rahajanarina and Dollar, 2004; Schwitzer and Lork, 2004; N. Garbutt, pers. comm.; P. C. Wright, pers. comm.). In addition, the aye-aye has been sighted in the northeastern forests of Daraina (part of the newly-declared Loky-Manambato Protected Area) (Randrianarisoa et al., 1999), as well as in the Anjiamangirana and Maroala Classified Forests (E. E. Louis Jr., pers. obs.). Although the aye-aye occurs in many protected areas, its presence is often based only on signs and infrequent sightings, so there is little understanding of population size and dynamics. There is an urgent need for a systematic census of this animal throughout its range, with the ultimate objective of developing a conservation action plan for the species.\nAs of 2010 there were approximately 50 aye-ayes in various zoological collections worldwide (ISIS, 2009). \n",
            "_where_to_see_it":"Although seeing Daubentonia in the wild requires great patience and diligence, visitors to Madagascar now stand a fair chance of encountering this strange animal, once considered one of Nature’s greatest rarities. Nonetheless, it is still one of the most desirable target species for the dedicated primate-watcher, and a sighting is by no means guaranteed. The easiest place to see it is on Ile Roger, or “Aye-aye Island,” located just 2–3 km from the Mananara-Nord airstrip. Some 13 animals were introduced onto this 30-ha island over the course of seven years, and several animals are still to be found there. The island is mainly covered by an overgrown plantation that is being reclaimed by forest, but viewing conditions are excellent. The visitor can also see northern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur occidentalis) and white-fronted brown lemur (Eulemur albifrons) on the same trip. Good accommodation is available at Bungalows Aye-aye, located less than 100 m from the airstrip, and this facility can arrange visits to the island.\nThe next best chance is the island of Nosy Mangabe in the Bay of Antongil, which is easily reached by boat from Maroantsetra. There you have a good chance of seeing an aye-aye if you spend one or two nights on this small island, especially along the stretch of beach right in front of the campsite. Nosy Mangabe is included in several tour circuits, and camping facilities are available on the island.\nAye-ayes are occasionally sighted at several other tourist destinations, including the Analamazaotra Special Reserve at Andasibe, Montagne d’Ambre National Park, and Ranomafana National Park, but it is far more likely that visitors will only see signs of aye- aye, such as holes gnawed in tree bark, partially gnawed ramy nuts, or the occasional nest. \n",
